Don't fright for(nanana...)
Rainy night and the worked all day
We got jobs caus there's bills to play
We got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride
My heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flash to flash, one to one (and it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK
Our time, our way
So hold me close better hand on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life
Our world, our flight
If we stand side by side (all night)
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll be live
In my heart till the day I die
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
(Solo)
My heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flash to flash, one to one (and it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
