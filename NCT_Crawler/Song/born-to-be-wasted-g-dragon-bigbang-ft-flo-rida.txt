                        oh the beat's gonna bash gonna break it up
this car's goin' fast gonna speed it up
the night's not gonna last so let's keep it up
we were born to be wasted

oh the rock's not gonna stop so let's rip it up
the beats are gonna drop you can trip em' up
your mind is on fire but it's not enough
we were born to be wasted

this gun's blowin up it's just a warning shot
this plane's takin' off on a terror run
this night's gonna end like a missile drop
we were born to be wasted

baby out loud
knew that it would come to this
ain't worth livin
if u can't get your kicks
