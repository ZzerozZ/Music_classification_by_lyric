                        Harry got up
 Dressed all in black
 Went down to the station
 And he never came back
 They found his clothing
 Scattered somewhere down the track
 And he won't be down on wall street
 In the morning

 He had a home
 The love of a girl
 But men get lost sometimes
 As years unfurl
 One day he crossed some line
 And he was too much in this world
 But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

 In a new york minute
 Everything can change
 In a new york minute
 Things can get pretty strange
 In a new york minute
 Everything can change
 In a new york minute

 Lying here in the darkness
 I hear the sirens wail
 Somebody going to emergency
 Somebody's going to jail
 If you find somebody to love in this world
 You better hand on tooth and nail
 The wolf is always at the door

 In a new york minute
 Everything can change
 In a new york minute
 Things can get a little strange
 In a new york minute
 Everything can change
 In a new york minute

 And in these days
 When darkness falls early
 And people rush home
 To the ones they love
 You better take a fool's advice
 And tak care of your own
 One day they're here;
 Next day they're gone

 I pulled my coat around my shoulders
 And took a walk down through the park
 The leaves were falling around me
 The groaning city in the gathering dark
 On some solitary rock
 A desperate lover left his mark,
 'Baby, I've changed. Please come back. '

 What the head makes cloudy
 The heart makes very clear
 The days were so much brighter
 In the time when she was here
 But I know there's somebody somewhere
 Make these dark clouds disappear
 Until that day, I have to believe
 I believe, I believe

 In a new york minute
 Everything can change
 In a new york minute
 You can get out of the rain
 In a new york minute
 Everything can change
 In a new york minute
                        
                    |
