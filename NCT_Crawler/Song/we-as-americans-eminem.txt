R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        There's an intruder in my house
 He cut my phone-lines, can't dial out
 I scream for police but I doubt
 They're gonna hear me when I shout A couple of cocktails will send me to jail
 There's a couple of cops hot on my trail
 But this time, when I get pulled over
 There's a Doberman, Pinscher and a Pitbull in the seat
 These pigs'll get bit fooling with me Quit fooling with me
 Bitch, you're gonna see
 No pistol in the seat
 Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
 And which you're gonna see in the long run
 I'ma be the wrong one You wanna harass with this Limo tinted glass
 Flashin' that flash-light on my ass, where was you at?
 Last night when them assholes
 Ran up on my grass
 Rapper slash actor
 Kiss the crack on my cracker slashed ass They took away my right to bear arms
 What I'm posed to fight with bear palms?
 Yeah, right
 They coming with bombs, I'm comin' with flare-guns
 We as Americans We as a Americans, us as a citizen
 Gotta protect ourselves, look at our *** has been
 We better check ourselves livin' up in these streets
 Through worse and through better health
 Surviving by any means We as Americans, us as a citizen
 We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
 We better check ourselves, look at our *** has been
 Take a look where you live
 This is America and we are Americans I'ma make Vuku bucks wearin' Vuku vests
 Drama hanging over my head like a Voodoo Hex
 I could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
 But you know who with an S tattooed to my chest But I've innested, now I got the Industry pissy
 Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty it's funny
 We got a buzz spreading quicker
 Than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty *** money, I don't rap for dead presidents
 I'd rather see the president dead
 It's never been said
 But I said precedents and the standards
 And they can't stand it My name should've been ***
 The *** should've been plastered
 On my forehead with a stamp
 I should've been blasted
 I should've been had a cap pulled in my ass
 But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
 *** that ***
 I done seen a fastest rap ***
 And turning into some pap-pap ***
 That quick, snap click
 But this time they got *** automatic
 And no one gon' test this mon, clack We as a Americans, us as a citizen
 Gotta protect ourselves, look at our *** has been
 We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
 Through worse and through better health
 Surviving by any means We as Americans, us as a citizen
 We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
 We better check ourselves, look at our *** has been
 Take a look where you live
 This is America and we are Americans I got a secret if you can keep it between us
 I tuck two Nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
 Under my Long Johns, under my Sean Johns
 When running with the long arm or the long long gone I'ma do five years or less than that
 No questions asked
 It might be a good idea to stop right here
 And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
 Already got a steady infrared nipped on my head A target on my back, bigger problems than that
 Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gone send a task
 I ain't gone even ask, they ain't gone let me pack
 They ain't gone gimme my semi but I got my whizz at We as a Americans, us as a citizen
 Gotta protect ourselves, look at our *** has been
 We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
 Through worse and through better health
 Surviving by any means We as Americans, us as a citizen
 We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
 We better check ourselves, look at our *** has been
 Take a look where you live
 This is America and we are Americans
