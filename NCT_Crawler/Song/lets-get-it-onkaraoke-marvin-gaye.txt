                        I've been really tryin baby
 Tryin to hold back this feeling for so long
 And if you feel like I feel baby
 Come on, oh come on, ooh

 Let's get it on, ow baby
 Let's get it on, let's love baby
 Let's get it on, sugar
 Let's get it on, woo

 We're all sensitive people with so much to give
 Understanding sugar
 Since we got to be, let's live, I love you
 There's nothin' wrong with me lovin' you, baby no no
 And givin' yourself to me can never be wrong
 If the love is true, oh baby ooh

 Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be, ooh ooh
 I'm askin' you baby to get it on with me, ooh ooh ooh
 I ain't goin' to worry, I ain't goin' to push, won't push you baby
 So come on come on come on come on come on baby
 Stop beatin' round the bush, hey

 Let's get it on, ooh ooh
 Let's get it on, you know what I'm talkin' about
 Come on baby, hey hey, let your love come out
 If you believe in love let's get it on, ooh
 Let's get it on baby, this minute, oh yeah
 Let's get in on ee___
 Please get it on, hey hey
 Come on come on come on come on come on darlin'
 Stop beatin'round the bush, oh, gonna get it on
 Beggin'you baby I want to get it on
 You don't have to worry that it's wrong
 If the spirit moves you, let me groove you
 Good, let your love come down, oh
 Get it on, come on baby, do you know I mean it
 I've been sanctified, hey hey
 Girl you give me good feelings, so good
 Somethin' like summer time
