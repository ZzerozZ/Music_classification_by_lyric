                        Bài hát: Half Time - Amy Winehouse

Simple sweet guitar, humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place

And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance

You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance

[Chorus]
Half time
Time to make it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole

You should thank your lucky stars
Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with a bliss

[Chorus]
Half time
Time to make it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

My lyrics reveling
Some natural vibe
It's a kind of laid back feeling
Oh just let it ride

And when Frank Sinatra Sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard ***
It pacifies my ache

[Chorus]
Half time
Time to make it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
                        
                    |
