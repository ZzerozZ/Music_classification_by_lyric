                        Bài hát: Apologise (Acoustic Version) - Pixie Lott

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But i just can't make a sound

You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wa-a-it
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think i'd turn around
And sa-a-y

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late-e-e
Said it's too late to apologize
It's too late-e-e
Ooooh wait-t-t, yeah yeah

I'd take another chance
Take a fall take a shot for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But that's nothing new

Yeah yeah

I loved you with the fire red
Now it's turning blue
And you sa-a-y
Sorry like and angel
Heaven let me think was you
Now i'm afraid-d-d

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late-e-e
Said it's too late to apologize
It's too late-e-e
Said it's too late to apologize
It's too late-e-e
Yeah-e-yeah
Said it's too late to apologize
It's too late-e-e
Yeah-e-yeah-h-h

Holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
