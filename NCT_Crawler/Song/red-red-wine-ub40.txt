                        Red, red wine
 Goes to my head
 Makes me forget that I...still need her so. Red, red wine
 It's up to you
 All I can do, I've done
 Memories won't go, memories won't go. I'd have sworn that with time
 Thoughts of you would leave my head
 I was wrong, now I find
 Just one thing makes me forget: Red, red wine
 Stay close to me
 Don't let me be alone
 It's tearing apart...my blue heart. I'd have sworn that with time
 Thoughts of you would leave my head
 I was wrong, now I find
 Just one thing makes me forget: Red, red wine
 Stay close to me
 Don't let me be alone
 It's tearing apart...my blue, blue heart. Red, red wine, you make me feel so fine
 You keep me rockin' all of the time
 Red, red wine, you make me feel so grand
 I feel a million dollar when you're just in my hand
 Red, red wine, you make me feel so sad
 Any time I see you go, it make me feel bad
 Red, red wine, you make me feel so fine
 Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline. (Red, red wine)
 Red, red wine, you give me whole heap of zing
 Whole heap of zing; you make me do my own thing
 (It's up to you...)
 Red, red wine, you give enough of love
 You're a kind of lovin' like a blessing from above
 Red, red wine, I loved you right from the start
 Right from the start, with all of my heart
 Red, red wine in an eighties style
 Red, red wine in a modern beat style
 Yeah. (I'd have sworn...)
 Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
 (That with time)
 Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
 (Thoughts of you would leave my head)
 Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine
 You make me feel fine all of the time
 Red, red wine, you make me feel so fine
 Monkey pack him Rizla pon the sweet Dep line
 The line broke, the monkey get choked
 Bunbah, ganjapani, little rubber boat. (Red, red wine)
 Red, red wine, I'm gonna hold on to you
 Hold on to you 'cause I know you love truth
 (Stay close to me)
 Red, red wine, I'm gonna love you 'til I die
 Love you 'til I die, and that's no lie
 (Don't let me be alone)
 Red, red wine, can't get you off my mind
 Wherever you may be, I'll surely find
 (It's tearing apart...)
 I'll surely find
 Make no fuss
 (My blue heart) -
 Just stick with us. (I'd have sworn...)
 Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
 (That with time)
 Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
 (Thoughts of you would leave my head)
 Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine
 You make me feel fine all of the time
 Red, red wine, you make me feel so fine
 Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline
 The line broke, the monkey get choked
 Bunbah, ganjapani, little rubber boat. (Red, red wine)
 Red, red wine, you give me not awful love
 You're a kind of lovin' like a blessing from above
 (Stay close to me)
 Red, red wine, I loved you right from the start
 Right from the start, with all of my heart
 (Don't let me be alone)
 Red, red wine, you give me whole heap of zing
 Whole heap of zing; you make me do my own thing
 Red, red wine in an eighties style
 Red, red wine in a modern beat style
 Yeah. Red, red wine, you make me feel so fine
 You keep me rockin' all of the time
 (Red red wine)
 Red, red wine, you make me feel so grand
 I feel a million dollars when you just in my hand
 (Stay close to me)
 Red, red wine, you make me feel so sad
 Any time I see you go...
