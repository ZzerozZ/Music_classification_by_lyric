[00:-2.00]Daughtry - You Don't Belong
[00:-1.00]

With time to kill and an empty tomb, I
Always find a way to pass the time with you
Dark and smokey rooms
I can hardly stand the fumes
Telling me that you mean no harm, you
Stand me up like a crutch, another arm
But only when I'm gone
Have I been away too long?

No
You don't belong to me
I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, its hard to be strong
No you'd tell me anything
Look what you've done to me
And still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

Any given time or place, I
Never will forget the disgrace on
(Your face so full of love
Will it ever be enough?)
Ten feet tall and bullet proof, I
Never thought that I had a thing to lose
Well it looks like after all
I'm gonna have to choose

No
You don't belong to me
I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, its hard to be strong
No you'd tell me anything
Look what you've done to me
And still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

You help pass the time
But I'm doing fine on my own
So there's no good reason why to live such a lie
Tell me have I been gone away too long?

No
You don't belong to me
I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, its hard to be strong
No you'd tell me anything
Look what you've done to me
And still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

You don't belong to me
I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, its hard to be strong
You'd tell me anything
Look what you've done to me
And still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

Long gone
