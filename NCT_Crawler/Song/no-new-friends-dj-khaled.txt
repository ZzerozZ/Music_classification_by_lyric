                        Yeah I stay down with my day one niggas and we in the club screaming

[Hook]
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I still ride with my day one niggas, I don't really need
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one so I say
*** all y'all niggas except my niggas
*** all y'all niggas except my niggas
One more time
*** all ya'll niggas except my niggas
*** all ya'll niggas, stay down from day one so I say
(*** a fake friend, where your real friends at? Started!)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Man this *** so ill that we had to restart it
H-town my second home like I'm James Harden
Money counter go burrr when you sellin' out the Garden
Four car garage, pornstar ménage
Birdman go brrr cause he know this *** retarded
*** her on the floor before we make it to the bed
That's what your ass really call started from the bottom, yes lord
OVO Sound man I'm proud of my niggas
Knew that we would make it never doubted my niggas
All my bitches love me
If I had a baby mama she would probably be richer then a lot of you niggas
Aye that's luxury dawg, day one niggas man ya'll stuck with me dawg
Ever since Youtube niggas been calling me the leader of the new school
*** with me dawg, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Your bitch all in my photographs, ho niggas got hate for me
Big homies all certified, nothing niggas gon' take from me
Follow codes, study game, feed fam nigga *** fame
All black my whip foreign, these bad hoes keep tiptoeing
Down in Turks and Caicos, dope boy that's my dress code
All I hug is blood nigga, Khaled that's my flesh tho
All I want is love nigga, money bring that stress tho
Smoke good I love life, strip club like erry night
Every night my same niggas, day one, straight menace (Rozay!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, I'm here with my niggas, I'm too high to be friendly
They throw dirt on my name, well that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hating, I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies, I wish we could trade places
Bitch we good-fellas, boy all them niggas with you they just pall bearers
And if we ball catch us, remember sip slow, live fast
Young Money, stay young
I been Cash Money since day one
Tunechi

[Hook]

[Outro: Future]
*** all y'all niggas except my niggas
*** them other niggas cuz' I'm down for my niggas
