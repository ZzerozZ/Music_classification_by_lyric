                        Bài hát: Listen To The Man - George Ezra

I feel your head resting heavy on your single bed
I want to hear all about it 
Get it all of your chest, oh
I feel the tears and you’re not alone, oh
When I hold you, well I won’t let go, oh

Why should we care for what they’re selling us anyway?
We’re so younger than you know, whoa
You don’t have to be there, babe
You don’t have to be scared, babe
You don’t need of plan of what you wanna do
Won’t you listen to the man that’s loving you

Your world keeps spinning and you can’t jump off
But I will catch you if you fall I can’t tell you enough
I hate to hear that you’re feeling low
I hate to hear that you won’t come home

Why should we care for what they’re selling us anyway?
We’re so younger than you know, whoa
You don’t have to be there, babe
You don’t have to be scared, babe
You don’t need of plan of what you wanna do
Won’t you listen to the man that’s loving you, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Easy, easy and a one, two, three, oh
Easy, breazy if you come with me, oh
Easy, easy and a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight, nine, nine, nine, nine.

You don’t have to be there, babe
You don’t have to be scared, babe
You don’t need of plan of what you wanna do
Won’t you listen to the man that’s loving you, whoa, whoa, whoa

You don’t have to be there, babe
You don’t have to be scared, babe
You don’t need of plan of what you wanna do
Won’t you listen to the man that’s loving you, whoa, whoa, whoa
