                        One less lonely girl 
One less lonely girl 
How many I told you’s 
And start overs and shoulders 
Have you cried on before 
How many promises be honest girl 
How many tears you let hit the floor 
How many bags you packed 
Just to take ’em back, tell me that 
How many either or’s 
But no more, 
If you let me inside of your world 
There’d be one less lonely girl 
Oh no 
I saw so many pretty faces 
Now all I see is you 
Oh no 
Don’t need these other pretty faces like I need you 
Cause when your mine in the world 
There’s gonna be one less lonely girl 
One less lonely girl 
One less lonely girl 
One less lonely girl 
There’s gonna be one less lonely girl 
I’m gonna put you first 
I’ll show you what your worth 
If you let me inside of your world 
There’s gonna be one less lonely girl 
Christmas wasn’t merry, 14th of February 
Not one of them spent with you 
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates 
And he didn’t even touch his food 
How many torn photographs are you taping back 
Tell me that you couldn’t see an open door 
But no more, 
If you let me inside of your world 
There’s gonna be one less lonely girl 
I saw so many pretty faces 
Now all I see is you 
Oh no 
Don’t need these other pretty faces like I need you 
’Cause when your mine in the world 
There’s gonna be one less lonely girl 
One less lonely girl 
One less lonely girl 
One less lonely girl 
I’m gonna put you first 
I’ll show you what your worth 
If you let me inside your world 
There’s gonna be one less lonely girl 
I can fix up your broken heart 
I can give you a brand new start 
I can make you believe, 
I just wanna set one girl free to fall 
She’s free to fall 
With me 
Her hearts locked and nowhere to get the key 
I’ll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl 

one less lonely girl 
There’s gonna be one less lonely girl 
One less lonely girl 
One less lonely girl 
I'm gonna put you first 
I'll show you what your worth 
If you let me inside your world 
There's gunna be one less lonely girl
