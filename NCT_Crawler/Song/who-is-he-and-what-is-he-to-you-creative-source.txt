                        Who is he
 What is he to you

 Who is he
 What is he to you

 Who is he
 What is he to you

 Who is he
 What is he to you

 A man we passed just
 Tried to stare me down
 And when I looked at you, girl
 You looked at the ground
 Yes, you did

 Now I don't know who he is
 But I think that you do
 Dad gum it, who is he
 And what is he to you

 Something in my heart
 And in your eyes, oh, girl
 Tells me he's not someone
 Just passing by, oh, no

 And when you cleared your throat
 Was that your cue, oh, girl
 Dad gum it, who is he
 And what is he to you, oh, girl

 When I add the
 Sum of you and me
 I get confused cause
 I keep coming up with three
 You know that ain't right, baby

 You're too much for one man
 But not enough for two
 Dad gum it, who is he
 And what is he to you

 You tell me men
 Don't have much intuition
 That's what you said
 Is that what think
 Or are you only wishing

 Before you wreck your old home
 And search another new
 Dad gum it, who is he
 And what is he to you

 Dad gum it, who is he
 And what is he to you
 Dad gum it, who is he
 And what is he to you

 Dad gum it, who is he
 And what is he to you
                        
                    |
