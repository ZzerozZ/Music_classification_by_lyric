                        You were always there to hold my hand
When times were hard to understand
But now the tides of time have turned
They keep changing

Seasons range, but you remain the same
A steady heart, a sun to rain
You'll be the light that's shining bright
High above me

Autumn gold losing hold
We are leaves meant to fall
There's a meaning to all that fades

Freezing winds were stayed by warming words
To touch your healing to the hurt
I'll treasure every lesson learned to the embers

Fight her face
Wash his pain

Fire fails, blushes pale
We will answer the call
There's a meaning to all

Seeds of eulogy to sow along with dreams
Fill the need that can leave us grieving alone

Frail is our beauty in the end
But all we count is sentiment

A memory stays to guide the way, and whisper
Don't lose sight, don't deny
We are leaves meant to fall
There's a meaning to all our

Seeds of eulogy to sow along with dreams
Fills the need that can leave us grieving alone
A symphony resounding in our minds
Guides us through what we knew would come all a long

Sometimes I feel I don't have the words
Sometimes I feel I'm not being heard
And then I fear I'm feeling nothing more

Sometimes I feel I don't want this change
I think we all have to rearrange
And now I feel there's no one losing me

Seeds of eulogy to sow along with dreams
Fill the need that can leave us grieving alone
A symphony resounding in our minds
Guides us though
As you hear me
As you do,
As you need me

Making true

What we knew would come all along
                        
                    |
