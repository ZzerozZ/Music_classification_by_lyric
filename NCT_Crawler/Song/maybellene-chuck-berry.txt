                        Maybellene, why can't you be true
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
 You've started back doin' the things you used to do As I was motivatin' over the hill
 I saw Mabellene in a Coup de Ville
 A Cadillac arollin' on the open road
 Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
 The Cadillac doin' about ninety-five
 She's bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side
 Maybellene
 Why can't you be true
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
 You've started back doin' the things you used to do The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
 The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
 It then got cloudy and started to rain
 I tooted my horn for a passin' lane
 The rainwater blowin' all under my hood
 I know that I was doin' my motor good
 Maybellene
 Why can't you be true
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
 You've started back doin' the things you used to do Oh, Maybellene
 Why can't you be true
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
 You've started back doin' the things you used to do The motor cooled down the heat went down
 And that's when I heard that highway sound
 The Cadillac asittin' like a ton of lead
 A hundred and ten half a mile aheadv The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
 And I caught Mabellene at the top of the hill
 Maybellene
 Why can't you be true
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
 You've started back doin' the things you used to do
