                        Flying Without Wings - Westlife

[Shane:] 
Everybody' s looking for that something 
One thing that makes it all complete 
You'll find it in the strangest places 
Places you never knew it could be 

Some find it in the face of their children 
Some find it in their lover's eyes 
Who can deny the joy it brings 
When you've found that special thing 
You're flying without wings 

[Mark:] 
Some find it sharing every morning 
Some in their solitary lives 
You'll find it in the words of others 
A simple line can make you laugh or cry 

You'll find it in the deepest friendship 
The kind you cherish all your life 
And when you know how much that means 
You've found that special thing 
You're flying without wings 

So, impossible as they may seem 
You've got to fight for every dream 
Cos who's to know which one you let go 
Would have made you complete 

[Shane:] 
Well, for me it's waking up beside you 
To watch the sunrise on your face 
To know that I can say I love you 
In any given time or place 

[Mark:] 
It 's little things that only I know 
Those are the things that make you mine 
And it's like flying without wings 
Cos you're my special thing 
I'm flying without wings 

[Shane:] 
A nd you're the place my life begins 
And you'll be where it ends 

[Mark:] 
I'm flying without wings 
And that's the joy you bring 
I'm flying without wings
                        
                    |
