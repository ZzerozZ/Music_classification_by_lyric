                        Bài hát: Father And Son(Album Version) - Boyzone

It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know

Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm, when you've found
Something going on

Take your time, think a lot
Think of everthing you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

How can I try to explain?
When I do, he turns away again
And it's always been the same
Same old story

From the moment I could talk
I was old enough to listen
Now there's a way and I know
That I have to go away I know, I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down and take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through

Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

All the times, that I've cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
And it's hard
But it's harder to ignore it

If they were right, I'd agree
But it's them they know, not me
Now there's a way and I know that
I have to go away I know, I have to go
                        
                    |
