                        I'm very sure
 This never happened to me before
 I met you and now I'm sure
 This never happened before Now I see
 This is the way it's supposed to be
 I met you and now I see
 This is the way it should be This is the way it should be for lovers
 They shouldn't go it alone
 It's not so good when you're on your own So come to me
 Now we can be what we wanna be
 I love you and now I see
 This is the way it should be
 This is the way it should be This is the way it should be for lovers
 They shouldn't go it alone
 It's not so good when you're on your own I'm very sure
 This never happened to me before
 I met you and now I'm sure
 This never happened before
 (This never happened) This never happened before
 (This never happened)
 This never happened before
 (This never happened before)
