                        Bài hát: My Boy - Billie Eilish

My boy's being sus he was shady enough but now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends and by that I mean
He cuts em off

(What?!)

My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

My boy's being sus and he don't know how to cuss, he just sounds like he's tryna be his father (who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar and by that I mean he said he'd "change"

My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

My boy... I love... my split ends
My boy... I love...
(Alright dude, go trip over a knife)

My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promise
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

You want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine, and if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine, and if you want a good girl, then goodbye
