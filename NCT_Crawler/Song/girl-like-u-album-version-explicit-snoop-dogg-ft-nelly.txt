                        If I didn't have no dough, would U love me?
 If we didn't have a place to go, would U still be there?
 Would U leave me alone if the chips were down?
 Would U stay around and be down? Oh girl I gotta have a chick like U
 I gotta have a girl like U
 I gotta have a chick like U
 I gotta have a girl like U Hey yo Dunc, who dat girl standing there like dat?
 Lookin' from the front but I can see what's in da back
 Hips like O, thighs like O
 Pretty toes in a row, they lookin' like OO I don't know nephew, let's do what we do
 Let's just slide up on these hoes and put this pimpin' to use
 And then what what we do, what we do
 You take the one in the white, I'll take the one in the blue If I didn't have no dough, would U love me?
 If we didn't have a place to go, would U still be there?
 Would U leave me alone if the chips are down?
 Would U stay around and be down? Oh girl I gotta have a chick like U
 I gotta have a girl like U
 I gotta have a chick like U
 I gotta have a girl like U I don't know if U been told
 But U look like U should be gold
 You're so precious, the way U shape up
 I'm just here to help U step your game up You look like a dime right from here
 You can dive in half of the bullet and die for me
 'Cos you can fly, you be fly, you can fly with me
 And when I fly another country, you can fly with me If I didn't have no dough, would U love me?
 If we didn't have a place to go, would U still be there?
 Would U leave me alone if the chips were down?
 Would U stay around and be down? Oh girl I gotta have a chick like U
 I gotta have a girl like U
 I gotta have a chick like U
 I gotta have a girl like U Now as the night winds down and the weed gets low
 Players still playin' an' I'm still on the flow

 I just want to be your desire Eva Keneva best believer
 You not a dime peice you a diva
 Take it from me you can be the
 O N E, if you roll with me Now if looks was a case, baby gurl wud be federal
 The top half incredible, bottom half edable
 I ain't tellin' you what I heard man, I'm tellin' you what I know
 An' I ain't tellin' her where to stay an' where to go An if she want we can take a trip down

 An he from Longbeach, I'm from a little town
 An' it's low key, guess who where tha crown If I didn't have no dough, would U love me?
 If we didn't have a place to go, would U still be there?
 Would U leave me alone if the chips are down?

 Everybody clap your hands
 If you came to party with tha D O double G an'
