                        Bài hát: Merry Christmas Everyone (Extended) - Shakin' Stevens

Snow is falling,
All around me,
Children playing,
Having fun.

It's the season,
Love and understanding,
Merry Christmas everyone.

Time for parties and celebration,
People dancing all night long,
Time for presents,
And exchanging kisses,
Time for singing Christmas songs.

We're gonna have a party tonight,
I'm gonna find that girl underneath the mistletoe,
We'll kiss by candlelight.

Room is swaying, records playing,
All the old songs, we love to hear,
All I wish that everyday was christmas,
What a nice way to spend the year.

We're gonna have a party tonight,
I'm gonna find that girl underneath the mistletoe,
We'll kiss by candlelight.

Snow is fallin,
All around me,
Children playing,
Having fun,
It's the season,
Love and understanding,
Merry Christmas everyone,
Merry Christmas everyone.

Ooh merry Christmas everyone.

Snow is falling,
All around me,
Children playing,
Having fun,
It's the season,
Love and understanding,
Merry Christmas everyone.

Snow is falling,
All around me,
Children playing,
Having fun,
It's the season,
Love and understanding,
Merry Christmas everyone.

Snow is falling,
All around me,
Children playing,
Having fun,
It's the season,
Love and understanding,
Merry Christmas everyone,
Merry Christmas everyone,
Merry Christmas everyone.
