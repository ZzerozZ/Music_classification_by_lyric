Avril Lavigne - Mobile

Went back home again
This sucks gotta pack up and leave again
Say goodbye to all my friends
Can't say when I'll be there again
It's time now to turn around
Turn my back on
Everything (turn my back on) everything....
Everything's changing when I turn around
All out of my control I'm a mobile.
Everything's changing when I turn around
All out of my control I'm a mobile.

Start back at this life
Stretch myself back into the vibe
I'm waking up to say I've tried
Instead of waking up to another TV guide
It's time now to turn around
Turn and walk on this crazy ground oh oh oh....
Everything's changing out of what I know
Everywhere I go I'm a mobile
I'm a mobile
Hanging from the ceiling life's a mobile spinning round
With mixed feelings crazy & wild ...
Sometimes I wanna scream out loud ....

Everything's changing
Everywhere I go
All out of my control
Everything's changing
Everywhere I go out of what I know

la la la la la la (la la)
la la la la la la (la la)
la la la la la la (la la la)
la la la la la la
