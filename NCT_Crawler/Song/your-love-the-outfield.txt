                        Josie's on a vacation far away
 Come around and talk it over
 So many things that I wanna say
 You know I like my girls a little bit older I just wanna use your love tonight
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight I ain't got many friends left to talk to
 Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
 You know I'd do anything for you
 Stay the night but keep it undercover I just wanna use your love tonight
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight Try to stop my hands from shaking
 But something in my mind's not making sense
 It's been a while since we were all alone
 I can't hide the way I'm feeling As you're leaving, please would you close the door?
 And don't forget what I told you
 Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong
 Another shoulder to cry upon I just wanna use your love tonight
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight I just wanna use your love tonight
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight I just wanna use your love tonight
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight Use your love
 Lose your love
