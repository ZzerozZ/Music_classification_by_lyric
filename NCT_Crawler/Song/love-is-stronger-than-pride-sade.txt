                        I won't pretend that I intend to stop living
 I won't pretend I'm good at forgiving
 But I can't hate you
 Though I have tried
 Aaa, aaa, aaa, aaa, aaa I still really, really love you
 Love is stronger than pride
 I still really, really love you
 Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm I won't pretend that I intend to stop living
 I won't pretend I'm good at forgiving
 But I can't hate you
 Although I have tried
 Mmm, mmm, mmm, aaa, aaa I still really, really love you
 Love is stronger than pride
 I still really, really love you
 Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm Sitting here wasting my time
 Be like, waiting for the sun to rise
 It's all too clear
 Things come and go Sitting here waiting for you
 Would be like waiting for winter
 It's gonna be cold
 There may even be snow I still really, really love you
 Love is stronger than pride
 I still really, really love you
 Love is stronger
 I still really love you
 Love is stronger than pride
 Yeah, yeah, yea
