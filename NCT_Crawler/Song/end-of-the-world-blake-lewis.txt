                        First act I wake to find the hope
 To see you simply staring back at me
 But still there's only emptiness calling To break the dream I once believed
 Now I'm scared that this reality
 Is much too heavy for me I'm too weak to be strong, I can't be the only one
 Holding on till the day you find me So meet me at the end of the world
 I'm waiting
 Meet me at the end of the world
 Please save me This could be the place where we start
 The rest of our lives, rest of our life
 Meet me at the end, the end of the world
 Meet me at the end of the world You found the place I hide within
 Like you see right through my skin
 And my heart to see I'm hopelessly wishing You can forgive all my mistakes
 Take them back and just erase all the
 Wrong and let our future get brighter I'm too weak to be strong, I can't be the only one
 Holding on till the day you find me So meet me at the end of the world
 I'm waiting
 Meet me at the end of the world
 Please save me This could be the place where we start
 The rest of our lives, rest of our life
 Meet me at the end, the end of the world
 Meet me at the end of the world Till these shadows disappear
 I still wait to find you here
 Still I'm haunted from the moment, I feared, oh Never forget what it's like
 To surrender in your eyes
 Holding on till the day you find me So meet me at the end of the world
 I'm waiting
 Meet me at the end of the world
 Please save me This could be the place where we start
 The rest of our lives, rest of our life So meet me at the end of the world
 I'm waiting
 Meet me at the end of the world
 Please save me This could be the place where we start
 The rest of our lives, rest of our life
 Meet me at the end, the end of the world
 Meet me at the end of the world
