                        Oh Lord I wish I had never been stoned
 'Cause when I get high I can't leave the women alone
 Omaha sheriff and his broad gettin' ready for slaughter
 Their lookin' for the man that turned on the mayor's daughter Omaha honey had a hold on a hell of a thing
 Down in a hollo', every evening you can hear her sing
 She said, monkey but showed me the Tulsa Turnaround
 Stepped on my toes, turned me on and turned me down
 Fit me like a hand in a glove, taught me how to love - why'a-all Five miles of road between me and my house
 A rosy-throat sheriff and his deputy trackin' me down
 Well I wish I was back at Bacon, takin' it easy
 But if a man's gonna eat fried chicken he's got to be greasy Omaha honey had a hold on a hell of a thi-ing
 Down in a hollo' every evening you can hear her si-ing
 She said that monkey but showed me the Tulsa Turnaround
 Stepped on my toes, turned me on and turned me down
 Fit me like a hand in a glove, taught me how to love - why'a-all Omaha honey had a hold on a hell of a thing
 Down in a hollo' every evening you can hear her si-ing
 She said, monkey but showed me the Tulsa Turnaround
 Stepped on my toes, turned me on and turned me down
 Fit me like a hand in a glove, taught me how to love - why'a-all
