                        Bài hát: John Wayne - Cigarettes After Sex

He's got so much love for her
But he doesn't know what to do
Sitting in the car
Waiting outside of school

He's in for a heartbreak if it's all been blind faith
From my point of view

Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy

He's got so much in his heart
But he doesn't know what to do
All he wants is her
Lying inside his room

He's always feeling cheated, telling all his secrets
That I couldn't keep

Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy

Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy
                        
                    |
