[Pitbull Rap]
Now first of all
Come on baby take it off,
Come on baby break me off
Then she said she loves the fact
That Pitbull's such a dog!
It's simple baby, I ain't picky.
Only rule of mine is no hickeys
Remember, lust can get tricky.
It's Mr. Worldwide and Ricky, dale

[Ricky Martin]

And I'm not tryna push your limits

A ittle fun, little love, little dancing

I'm not tryna get in your head
And I'm not tryna push your limits
Cause I just wanna make you feel special
A ittle fun, little love, little dancing

[Pitbull Rap]
Itâs the P to the I-I to the T-T to the B-B to the U and double the L
Iâm so hot, Iâm hotter than hell
Now baby turn around for Mr. Put It Down
Went from the block to the yacht to the G4
Down in DR, jet took a detour
Not from Maryland
But when it always comes to women there can always be more
Get it? Be more
Tupac, no when I get around
Baby nice to meet ya, Iâm Mr. Put It Down

Hola, oh my
Oh where you come from?
Oh wow, no high
To pick the right one

Someone that likes you

We need to want unclearly
You're gonna call me mr. put it down

Baby give me that, give me that
Hi give me that, give me that
Baby give me that, give me that
Hi give me that, give me that
Baby give me that, give me that
Hi give me that, give me that
Baby give me that, give me that
Hi give me that, give me that
