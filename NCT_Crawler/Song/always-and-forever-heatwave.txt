                        Always and forever, each moment with you
 Is just like a dream to me that somehow came true
 And I know tomorrow will still be the same
 'Cause we've got a life of love that won't ever change and Everyday love me your own special way
 Melt all my heart away with a smile
 Take time to tell me you really care
 And we'll share tomorrow together
 I'll always love you forever, forever There'll always be sunshine when I look at you
 It's something I can't explain just the things that you do
 And if you get lonely phone me and take
 A second to give to me that magic you make and Everyday love me your own special way
 Melt all my heart away with a smile
 Take time to tell me you really care
 And we'll share tomorrow together
 I'll always love you ever, ever Loving you is the thing that I've planned
 For a very long time
 Me with you, you with me, we as one
 Love together for a very long time
 Loving you, you, baby Always, forever love you
 Always, forever love you
 Always, forever love you I said, "Forever love you, love you"
 Ever and the day and one day
 Loving you, you, you, you, you
 Forever, tomorrow's tomorrow Ever and a day, ever and a day
 Ever, everyday, yeah, you
 Loving you forever, ever, you, you
 Forever
