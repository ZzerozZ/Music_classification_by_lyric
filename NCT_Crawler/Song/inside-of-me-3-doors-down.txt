                        Bài hát: Inside Of Me - 3 Doors Down

Always waiting for something
Searching for one thing
And I know it has to be there somewhere
All this room without knowing
The way this is going
As long as it takes me anywhere

There's life and there's one dance
There's fate and there's one chance
To find out who I want to be
And I know it's inside of me

I look to the far side
Searching for daylight
Something that is mine, all my own
And loving in hindsight
That won't work for my life
Let me forget all that went wrong

There's life and there's one dance
There's fate and there's one chance
To find out who I want to be
And I know it's inside of me
There's love in so much more
That waits behind that door
There's so much that I want to see
And I know it's inside of me

Oh, woah, woah
Oh, woah, woah, woah

There's life and there's one dance
There's fate and there's one chance
To find out who I want to be
And I know it's inside of me
There's love in so much more
That waits behind that door
There's so much that I want to see
And I know it's inside of me

It's inside of me
Oh, it's inside of me
Oh, woah
