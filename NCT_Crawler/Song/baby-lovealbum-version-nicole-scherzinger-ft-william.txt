                        Bài hát: Baby Love(Album Version) - Nicole Scherzinger, will.i.am 

I remember like it was yesterday
First kiss and I knew you changed the game
You have me, exactly, well you want it,
And I'm on it

And I ain't ever gonna let you get away
Holdin' hands never made me feel this way
So special, boy it's your, your smile
We so in love
(love)
La la la la
Yeah
We so in love
La la la la la
And I just can't get enough
Of your la la la la love
Yeah we so in love, love
I want you to know
You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up Oh boy (oh boy)
You're my every, everything that I could ever dream of
You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up Oh boy (oh boy)
You're my every, every, every, everything

Been a minute and we still holding it down
Butterflies every time you come around
You make me, so crazy
It's crazy, oh baby

And I don't ever wanna be with no one else
You're the only one that ever made me melt
You're special, boy it's your, your style
We so in love

La la la la
Yeah
We so in love
La la la la la
And I just can't get enough
Of your la la la la love
Yeah it's all I'm thinking of
Love, love
I want you to know

You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up Oh boy (oh boy)
You're my every, everything that I could ever dream of
You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up Oh boy (oh boy)
You're my every, everything that I could ever dream of
You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up Oh boy (oh boy)
You're my every, everything that I could ever dream of
You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up Oh boy (oh boy)
You're my every, every, every, everything

(Yeah)
Everything, everything, oh
Everything, everything, oh

[Will.I.Am]
You're my always and forever
You're my sunshine
On my mind, constant
Think about you all the time
You're my everything

Everything, everything, oh
Everything, everything, oh

[Will.I.Am]
You my new school (love)
You my old school (love)
And it's so true
You're the one I'm thinking of

You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up Oh boy (oh boy)
You're my every, everything that I could ever dream of
You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up Oh boy (oh boy)
You're my every, every, every, everything
You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up Oh boy (oh boy)
You're my every, every, every, everything
You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up Oh boy (oh boy)
(You make the sun come up on a cloudy day
You're my number one, you're my special thing)
You're my every, every, every, everything

Everything, everything, oh
Everything, everything, oh
You are my baby, baby, baby, baby love

Everything, everything, oh
Everything, everything, oh
You're my everything
You are my baby, baby, baby, baby love
