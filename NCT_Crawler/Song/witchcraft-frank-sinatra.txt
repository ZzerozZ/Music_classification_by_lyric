                        Those fingers in my hair
 That sly come-hither stare
 That strips my conscience bare
 It's witchcraft And I've got no defense for it
 The heat is too intense for it
 What good would common sense for it do? 'Cause it's witchcraft
 Wicked witchcraft
 And although, I know, it's strictly taboo When you arouse the need in me
 My heart says yes indeed in me
 Proceed with what you're leading me to It's such an ancient pitch
 But one I wouldn't switch
 'Cause there's no nicer witch than you 'Cause it's witchcraft
 That crazy witchcraft
 And although, I know, it's strictly taboo When you arouse the need in me
 My heart says yes indeed in me
 Proceed with what you're leading me to It's such an ancient pitch
 But one that I'd never switch
 'Cause there's no nicer witch than you
