                        Bài hát: Lost Boy - Troye Sivan

As the smile fell from your face, I fell with it
Our faces blue
There's a heart stain on the carpet
I left it, I left it with you

Yeah, the truth is that I'm sorry
Though I told you not to worry
It's just some don't care
Trying to kid myself
That I got my stuff together

So go get running, won't you hurry
While it's light out, while It's early
Before I start to miss, any part of this
And change my mind forever

I say I want to settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found

I don't care much for locks on the window
To keep me at bay
I leave you one last kiss on your pillow
'fore I fly away

Yeah, when you found a beginning
That this wasn't ever ending
Shouldn't stay too long
Cause we're both too young to give into forever

I say I want to settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy

So what are you waiting for
Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

So what are you waiting for
Someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

So what are you waiting for
Cause someone could love you more
I'm just lost boy, lost boy

So what are you waiting for
Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

I say I want to settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
(I'm just a lost boy, I'm just a lost boy, I'm just a lost boy)
Not ready to be found
(I'm just a lost boy, I'm just a lost boy)
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found.
