                        What's underneath the moon and stars
 What's underneath our closed sweet hearts
 Hidin' what we want to share
 Take my hand, I'll take you there There's a call on you while
 There's a snake in your bed
 And it's telling you something (it says)
 Yeah I like it like that!
 When you're feeling lonely
 Go help yourself
 Do whatever you desire Go throw your arrows
 Hit her heart
 If they don't react,
 Love who loves you back!
 The perfect storm
 What turns you on?
 You can have all that
 Love who loves you back! Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
 Turn me on, turn me on
 Love who loves you back!
 Turn me on, turn me on
 Love who loves you back!
 Turn me on, turn me on,
 Love who loves you back! What's real we have to scream to see
 Leaning closer next to me
 Count to three and lose control
 If you like it let me know There's a call on you while
 There's a snake in your bed
 And it's telling you something (it says)
 Yeah I like it like that!
 When you're feeling lonely
 Go help yourself
 Do whatever you desire Go throw your arrows
 Hit her heart
 If they don't react,
 Love who loves you back!
 The perfect storm
 What turns you on?
 You can have all that
 Love who loves you back! Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
 Turn me on, turn me on
 Love who loves you back!
 Turn me on, turn me on
 Love who loves you back!
 Turn me on, turn me on, Some are small, some are tall
 Some are born with it all
 Some are in it for the kill
 Some just do it for the thrill
 Archers aim your perfect mark and throw Throw your arrows
 Hit her heart
 If they don't react,
 Love who loves you back!
 The perfect storm
 What turns you on?
 You can have all that
 Love who loves you back! Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
 Turn me on, turn me on
 Love who loves you back!
 Turn me on, turn me on
 Love who loves you back!
 Turn me on, turn me on,
 Love who loves you back!
