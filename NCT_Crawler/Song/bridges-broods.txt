Rock|

                        Gave you a minute
 When you needed an hour
 Chose to push it aside
 Instead of leaving behind you
 If any word that I said
 Could have made you forget
 I'd have given you them all
 But it was all in your head Now we're burning all the bridges now
 Watching it go up in flames
 No way to build it up again
 And we're burning all the bridges now
 'Cause it was sink or swim
 And I went down, down, down And we're burning all the bridges
 Burning all the bridges now
 And we're burning all the bridges
 Burning all the bridges now If I didn't hit it
 Would you still say you needed me
 Guess I walked right into it
 Guess I made it too easy
 If any word that you said
 Could have made me forget
 Would I get up off the floor
 'Cause this is all in my head And we're burning all the bridges now
 Watching it go up in flames
 No way to build it up again And we're burning all the bridges
 Burning all the bridges now
 And we're burning all the bridges
 Burning all the bridges now Can we forget about it
 Can we forget
 Can we forget about it
 Can we forget Burning all the bridges
 Burning all the bridges now
 And we're burning all the bridges
 Burning all the bridges now
