                        Bài hát: Earned It (Fifty Shades Of Grey) (From The "Fifty Shades Of Grey" Soundtrack) - The Weeknd

You make it look like it’s magic
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so use to being used

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

'Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it

You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

On that lonely night
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it was only us
Convinced we were broken inside, inside
                        
                    |
