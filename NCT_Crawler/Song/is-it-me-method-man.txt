R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        Uh, yeah, y'all, guess whose back?
 Heh, cauli' flavored, momma crack
 Yeah, yeah, Scott Storch, Mr. M E F
 Know what I said, black people don't use the T-H
 Yo, yo, yo Guess who back though, crack dough, yes, eyes is hat low
 Stash 'dro, pimp on the side, you know how that go
 Rap flow, major, taste the flavor, all natural high
 Y'all gotta love it when the track go Ask Def Jam what's hot, three letters, M E F Man
 Been stopped, that's off top, young, fresh to death
 And you're not, no matter what the job, I'm the best man
 Rap C.E.O. minus the yes man I know that's right, so act right, Staten on the map
 Like f*** y'all, get stuck, y'all and have a bad night
 As I brush off you my shoulder, that's right
 My n**** Scott Storch keep bringing it back like Oh boy, dig it, I talk about it and I live it
 Been there, did it, s***ted and wiped my a** with it
 These critics saw the train for brains and must of missed it
 If they ain't got the s***, they'll never get it Is it me or is it these n***** in it for cheese
 Is it me all my enemies, hating on Killa Beez
 Is it me or is it me that ain't feeling M.C.'s
 With the top down wheeling the V, feeling the breeze Is it me or is it these n***** spitting the same
 Is it me all my enemies throwing s*** in the game
 Is it me or the industry that really got to change
 Once again it's Wu-Tang in case y'all forgot the name I spit germ, early bird gets worm, now
 Now that it's his turn, clowns don't get turns, now
 F*** with a chick perm, when she get hot, you get burned
 You see I'm not kidding, knowing these kids learn And and I'm that dude, ahh choo and allergic to wack jewels
 Blast if I have to and y'all don't give me no hassle
 Who rep Rotten Apple to death and get natural
 Make hard beats pound like the track do If you ask me, this raspy voice n**** is nasty
 Khaki's hanging off of his ass, eyes is glassy
 That's f***ed, that's us, n***** know where to catch me
 At 1-800 Get At Me My flow's, no holds barred, Holy Jihad
 It's the head n**** in charge, Meth, back on the job
 Like back in the days, back when, the game was hard
 And when they reminiscence over Wu, my God Is it me or is it these n***** in it for cheese
 Is it me all my enemies, hating on Killa Beez
 Is it me or is it me that ain't feeling M.C.'s
 With the top down wheeling the V, feeling the breeze Is it me or is it these n***** spitting the same
 Is it me all my enemies throwing s*** in the game
 Is it me or the industry that really got to change
 Once again it's Wu-Tang in case y'all forgot the name Until these rap n***** stepped up, checked up
 Man, this game is messed up, next up, you know what it is
 Don't get it f'd up Meth, what? F.Y.I., you need a heads up
 And I don't mean to beat you in the head but When you spit that, forget that, I eat these n***** food
 And the s*** wrapped, where Cliff at?
 Tell 'em Mr. Meth got his s*** back
 The gift back sign. sealed, delivered and gift wrapped
 And when you hear that click-clack That's real talk, some n***** will talk to the cops
 Get killed off, man how did you get caught with all the rocks
 And still walk, no matter what you mix with a pig
 You still pork and money is still forced Yeah, that was right on cue, new and improved
 All these dudes try'nna walk in my shoes, doing my moves
 But that's cool 'cause I'ma make it do what it do
 With this W, like I can I get a "Suu" motherf******? Is it me or is it these n***** in it for cheese
 Is it me all my enemies, hating on Killa Beez
 Is it me or is it me that ain't feeling M.C.'s
 With the top down wheeling the V, feeling the breeze Is it me or is it these n***** spitting the same
 Is it me all my enemies throwing s*** in the game
 Is it me or the industry that really got to change
 Once again it's Wu-Tang in case y'all forgot the name W T R B
 Wu-Tang Radio B****
