                        I hear, a voice say "Don't be so blind"
It's telling me all of these things 
That you would probably hide!
Am I your one and only desire?
Am I the reason you breathe, 
Or am I the reason you cry? 

Always, always, always,
Always, always, always,
I just can't live without you!

I love you! 
I hate you!
I can't get around you!
I breathe you,
I taste you!
I can't live without you!
I just can't take anymore
This life of solitude
I guess that I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you!

(Done with you, done with you, done with you, done with you, done with you)

I feel, like you don't want me around 
I guess I'll pack all my things
I guess I'll see you around
It's all, been bottled up till now
As I walk out your door 
All I can hear is the sound! 

Always, always, always, 
Always, always, always
I just can't live without you!

I love you,
I hate you,
I can't get around you!
I breathe you,
I taste you,
I can't live without you!
I just can't take anymore
This life of solitude
I guess that I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you.

I love you,
I hate you,
I can't live without you.

I wrap my hand around your heart,
Why would you tear my world apart?

Always, always, always, always. 

I see, the blood all over your hands 
Does it make you feel, more like a man?
Was it all, just a part of your plan? 
The pistol's shakin' in my hands
And all I hear is the sound!

I love you, 
I hate you,
I can't live around you!
I breathe you,
I taste you,
I can't live without you! 
I just can't take anymore
This life of solitude
I guess that I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you. 

I love you,
I hate you,
I can't live without you!
I love you,
I hate you,
I can't live without you. 
I just can't take anymore
This life of solitude
I pick myself off the floor,
And now I'm done with you. 

Always,
Always,
Always.
