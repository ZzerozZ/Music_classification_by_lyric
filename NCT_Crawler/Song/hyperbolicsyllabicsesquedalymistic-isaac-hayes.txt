                        I wanna come back
 'Coz I like it like that
 Your modus operandi
 Is really all right, out of sight Your sweet phalanges
 Know how to squeeze
 My gastronomical stupensity
 Is really satisfied when you're loving me Now, tell me, what I say?
 Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic I can't sleep at night
 But that's all right
 The M.D. tells me
 My heart's on strike Emanating, originating from a love asphyxiation
 He said I better slow down
 Before you drive me in the ground
 But what he doesn't know is I want another encore Now, what I say?
 Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic Let me stop procrastinatin'
 Standin' hear and narratin'
 Find my emancipator
 She's a love educator Cerebral, cerebellum, a medulla oblongata
 A slave's on a horse
 Every time she explores
 Just heard a discussion about a racial relationship Now, what I say?
