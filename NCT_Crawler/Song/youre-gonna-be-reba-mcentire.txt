                        Song: You're Gonna Be - Reba McEntire

6 pounds and 9 ounces, lookin' up at me
Like I have all the answers
I hope, I have the ones you need
I've never really done this, 
now I know what scared is Sometimes, 
I'll protect you from everything that's wrong

Other times, I'll let you just find out on your own
But that's when you'll be growin'
And the whole time I'll be knowin' 
You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
You're gonna cry but know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair but if you hang 
in there You're gonna see that sometimes bad is good

We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me
You're gonna be I'm afraid you'll 
have to suffer through some of my mistakes

Lord, knows I'll be trying, oh, to give you what it takes
What it takes to know the difference between 
getting by and livin' Cause anything worth 
doing is worth doing all the way

Just know you'll have to live with 
all the choices that you make
So make sure you're always givin' way 
more than you're takin' 
You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
You're gonna cry, but know that that's okay

Sometimes life's not fair, 
but if you just hang in there 
You're gonna see that sometimes bad is good
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me
You're gonna be Someone's everything

You're gonna see
Just what you are to me 
You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me
You're gonna be, always loved by me
