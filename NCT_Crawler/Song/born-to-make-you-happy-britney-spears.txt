                        I'm sitting here alone up in my room 
And thinking about the times that we've been through 
(oh my love) 
I'm looking at a picture in my hand 

Trying my best to understand 
I really want to know what we did wrong 
with a love that felt so strong 

If only you were here tonight 
I know that we could make it right 

I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 
'Cause you're the only one within my heart 
I was born to make you happy 
Always and forever you and me 
That's the way our life should be 
I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 

I know I've been a fool since you've been gone 
I'd better give it up and carry on (oh my love) 
'Cause living in a dream of you and me 
is not the way my life should be 

I don't want to cry a tear for you 
So forgive me if I do 
If only you were here tonight 
I know that we could make it right 

I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 
'Cause you're the only one within my heart 
I was born to make you happy 
Always and forever you and me 
That's the way our life should be 
I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 

I'd do anything, I'd give you my world 
I'd wait forever, to be your girl 
Just call out my name, 
and I will be there 
Just to show you how much I care 

I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 
'Cause you're the only one within my heart 
I was born to make you happy 
Always and forever you and me 
That's the way our life should be 
I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 
I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 
'Cause you're the only one within my heart 
I was born to make you happy 
Always and forever you and me 
That's the way our life should be 
I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 
I was born to make you happy 

Always and forever you and me 
That's the way our life should be 
I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy.
