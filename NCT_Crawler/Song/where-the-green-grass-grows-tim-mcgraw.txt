                        Six lanes, tail lights
Red ants marching into the night
Disappear to the left and right again
Another supper from a sack
A 99-cent heart attack
I've got a pounding head and an achin back
And the camels buried in the big straw stack

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the West
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

Well I'm from a map dot
A stop sign on a black top
Caught the first bus I could hop from there
But all of this glitter is getting dark
There's concrete growin in the city park
I don't know who my neighbors are
There's bars on the corners and bars on my heart

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the west
Plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the west
Plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Oh, where the green grass grows
                        
                    |
