                        Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
 Did everything you could, to be here for the night
 Man it feels good, everything is right
 Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
 My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
 I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
 Let-let-let-let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already livin'
 I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
 Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
 Poppa don't preach, all we do is just reach here
 Raised round killers, we just happy to be here
 Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
 While my hoes doing magic, voodoo moulin rouge
 That's a tactic that they use, *** 'em high then suck 'em dry
 Before you know it her Q7 is buzzing by
 The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
 The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins
 Yughck! This the life that we made
 Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
 Did everything you could, to be here for the night
 Man it feels good, everything is right
 Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
 My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
 I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
 Let-let-let-let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already livin'
 I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPY's
 Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
 Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
 Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (Woo!)
 They love me on my Ric Flair *** (Woo!)
 In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (Woo!)
 Who are you to be compared with? (Woo!)
 Ain't no niggas that you bled with
 Caught cases ran base and road aces
 Lick shots or left bodies with no traces
 Yughck! This the life that we made
 Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade nigga! Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
 Did everything you could, to be here for the night
 Man it feels good, everything is right
 Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
 My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
 I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
 Let-let-let-let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already livin'
 I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it Look, my ouija board don't never lie to me
 The best rapper living, I know who's alive to me
 Yeah, the competition's all but died to me
 Raah, I make these motha***as hide from me
 The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold
 You just posing for them pics so you can upload
 Yughck! This the life that we made
 Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade nigga! Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
 Did everything you could, to be here for the night
 Man it feels good, everything is right
 Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
 My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
 I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
 Let-let-let-let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already livin'
 I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it
