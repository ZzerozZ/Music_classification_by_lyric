                        Chocolate

Hey now call it a spliff 'cause you know that you will
Oh you bite your friend like chocolate
You say, we'll go where nobody knows, with guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no

Now we run run away from the boys in the blue, and my car smells like chocolate
Hey now think about what you do, think about what they say, think about how to think
Pause it play it, pause it play it, pause it

Oh we go where nobody knows, with guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe, we've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gunna' quit it. no we're never gunna' quit it no

Now you're never gunna' quit it, Now you're never gunna' quit it, Now you're never gunna' quit it
If you don't start smoking it, that's what she said
She said we're dressed in black, head to toe, with guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no

Hey now we're building up speed as we're approaching the hill
Oh my hair smells like chocolate
Hey now you say you're gunna' quit it but you're never gunna' quit it
Gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, go!
and play it cool

Oh and you said we go where nobody knows, with guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no
Yeah we're dressed in black, from head to toe, we've got guns hidden under our petticoats
We're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no

Well I think we better go, seriously better go
Said it's better than hanging on
Seriously better go, oh oh, well I think we better go
Said it's better than hanging on
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

We go where nobody knows, with guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no
Yeah we're dressed in black, head to toe, with guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gunna' quit it. no we're never gunna' quit it no
No no no

Well I think we better go, seriously better go
Said it's better than hanging on
Seriously better go, oh oh, well I think we better go
Said it's better than hanging on
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go
