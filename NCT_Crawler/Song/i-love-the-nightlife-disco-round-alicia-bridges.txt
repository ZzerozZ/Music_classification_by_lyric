                        I LOVE THE NIGHTLIFE
 Alicia Bridges Please don't talk about love tonight.
 Please don't talk about sweet love.
 Please don't talk about being true
 and all the trouble we've been through.
 Ah, please don't talk about all of the plans
 we had for fixin' this broken romance.

 I want to go where the people dance.
 I want some action ... I want to live! Action ... I got so much to give.
 I want to give it. I want to get some too. Oh, I ... Ohhh I ... I love the nightlife,
 I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
 Oh, I love the night life,
 I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea. Please don't talk about love tonight.
 Your sweet talking won't make it right.
 Love and lies just bring me down
 when you've got women all over town.
 You can love them all and when you're through,
 maybe that'll make, huh, a man out of you.
 I got to go where the people dance.
 I want some action ... I want to live! Action ... I got so much to give.
 I want to give it. I want to get some too. Oh, I ... Ohhh I ... I love the nightlife,
 I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
 Oh, I love the night life,
 I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea. Oh, I love the night life,
 I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
 Oh, I love the night life,
 I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
 I love the night life,
 I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
