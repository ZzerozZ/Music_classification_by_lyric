                        Bài hát: Another Life (Radio Mix) - Afrojack, David Guetta, Ester Dean

[Verse 1: Ester Dean] 
I'm waking up, thinking how we used to be 
I still hang on to our tied up dreams 
I wish we could turn back the hands of time 
Replace the poison that you left onto my mind 

[Chorus] 
Maybe we'll meet again in another life 
Maybe we're better in another paradise 
Maybe we will meet again 
Maybe we will fall again 

[Post-Chorus] 
In another life 
In another life 

[Verse 2] 
I can't imagine what this life would be 
We holdin' on to fading memories 
I love you, you love me, but this love sets you free 
But if you choose to leave, well I hope we'll meet 

[Chorus] 
Maybe we'll meet again in another life 
Maybe we're better in another paradise 
Maybe we will meet again 
Maybe we will fall again 

[Post-Chorus] 
In another life 

[Chorus] 
Maybe we'll meet again in another life 
Maybe we're better in another paradise 
Maybe we will meet again 
Maybe we will fall again 

[Post-Chorus] 
In another life 
In another life 
In another life
                        
                    |
