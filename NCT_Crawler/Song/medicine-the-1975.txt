                        Bài hát: Medicine - The 1975

[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say bye
Even in the state of you and I
And how can I refuse?
Yeah you rid me of the blues
Ever since you came into my life

[Chorus]
Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're a medicine)
Yeah, you're a medicine
(You're a medicine)

[Verse 2]
I, I wanna marry you
Said I, I adore you
And that's all I have to say bye-bye
And you opiate this hazy head of mine

[Chorus]
Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're a medicine)
Yeah, you're a medicine
(You're a medicine)

Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, youre a medicine)
Yeah, you're a medicine
(You're a medicine, yeah you're a medicine)
                        
                    |
