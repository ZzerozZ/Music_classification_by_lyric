                        Bài hát: Want U Back - Cher Lloyd, Snoop Dogg

Ugh! Mm, yeah... Lalalala, haha.. Ugh!
Hey, boy you never had much game
Thought I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away-way-way, ugh!
Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns, ugh!

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this, ugh!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this, ugh!

Boy you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back, I want you back
Want-want you, want you back, ugh!
I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
I want you back, I want you back
Want-want you, want you back, ugh!

Please, this ain't even jealousy
She ain't got a thing on me
Tryin' to rock them ugly jeans, jeans, jeans, ugh!
You clearly didn't think this through
If what I've been told is true
You'll be crawling back like boo hoo hoo, ugh!

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this, ugh!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this, ugh!

Boy you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back, I want you back
Want-want you, want you back, ugh!
I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
I want you back, I want you back
Want-want you, want you back, ugh!

Oooh, I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye, oh oh, oh oh
Oooh, and you might be with her
But I still had you first, oh oh, oh oh

Yeah, yeah... Yo!

Boy you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back, I want you back
Want-want you, want you back
I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
I want you back, I want you back
Want-want you, want you back, ugh!
I want you back, lalalala (Oooh)

I want you back, I want you back
Want-want you, want you back, ugh!
Oooh, I want u back, I want you back
Want-want you, want you back, ugh!

Just like a helicopter, brrrr
