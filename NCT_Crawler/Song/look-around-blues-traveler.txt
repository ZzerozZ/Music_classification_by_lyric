                        You'll get no answer from me
 About what I want or what I get
 Brave enough to speak, afraid to see
 Confuse the issue till you forget And I've tried
 To finally decide
 Why
 I'm in your face And if you can't already tell
 I am unable to let things go
 I'm told I do it very well
 But more important you should know That all the same
 You've got no one to blame, honey
 But yourself
 If you call that a waste 'Cause it ain't me
 That's been hurting you inside
 And if you've learned
 You'll know much more than I That you're gonna have to go and find it
 Have to dig beneath the ground
 You'll have to unearth every ugly stone
 That kept you on your own Simply put them down
 You're gonna have to look around You'll get no answer from me
 About what I get or want I want
 That was enough to make her leave
 She's not the first one come and gone And I don't care
 Buyer beware
 Of me
 'Cause it might get rough If you want peace then live alone
 If you wanna hide then find a stage
 Each a brief but perfect home
 To accommodate your rage And sometimes
 In the midst of all my crimes
 I feel lost
 Or have I lost enough? Remaining friends
 Remind me as they say
 It's up to you
 The things you throw away And still you're gonna have to go and find it
 You'll have to dig beneath the ground
 You'll have to unearth every ugly stone
 That kept you on your own And simply put them down
 You're gonna have to look around You're gonna have to look around
 You're gonna have to look around
