                        I look at the mountain, I look at the sun
 I look at everything Mother Nature has done
 Then I wanna know
 Why can't I find a love of my own I look at the skyline, I look at the trees
 I look at the moonlight, I feel the soft breeze
 Then I wanna know
 Why can't I find a love of my own Love, how I've waited for you
 But it looks like you'll never come
 So I sit down, sit down and think the thing over
 Is it something I've done? I look at the flowers in fullest bloom
 I should be happy but I'm filled with gloom
 'Cause I wanna know
 Why can't I find a love of my own 'Cause I wanna know
 Why can't I find a love of my own
