                        Bài hát: Ode To My Family - The Cranberries

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo... 

Understand the things I say, don't turn away from me, 
'Cause I've spent half my life out there, you wouldn't disagree. 
Do you see me? Do you see? Do you like me? 
Do you like me standing there? Do you notice? 
Do you know? Do you see me? Do you see me? 
Does anyone care? 

Unhappiness where's when I was young, 
And we didn't give a damn, 
'Cause we were raised, 
To see life as fun and take it if we can. 
My mother, my mother, 
She hold me, she hold me, when I was out there. 
My father, my father, 
He liked me, oh, he liked me. Does anyone care? 

Understand what I've become, it wasn't my design. 
And people ev'rywhere think, something better than I am. 
But I miss you, I miss, 'cause I liked it, 
'Cause I liked it, when I was out there. Do you know this? 
Do you know you did not find me. You did not find. 
Does anyone care? 

Unhappiness where's when I was young, 
And we didn't give a damn, 
'Cause we were raised, 
To see life as fun and take it if we can. 
My mother, my mother, 
She hold me, she hold me, when I was out there. 
My father, my father, 
He liked me, oh, he liked me. 

Does anyone care?... [X9]
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...
