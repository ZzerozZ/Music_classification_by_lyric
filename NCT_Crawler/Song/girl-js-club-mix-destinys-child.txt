                        [Verse 1 Beyonce]
 Take A Minute Girl Come Sit Down
 And Tell Us What's Been Happening
 In Your Face I Can See The Pain
 Don't You Try To Convince Us That You're Happy (Yeah)
 We've Seen This All Before
 But He's Taking Advantage Of Your Passion
 Because We've Come Too Far
 For You To Feel Alone
 You Don't Let Him Walk Over Your Heart
 I'm Telling You

 [Chorus:]
 Girl, I Can Tell You've Been Crying
 And You Needing Somebody To Talk To
 Girl, I Can Tell He's Been Lying
 And Pretending That He's Faithful And He Loves You
 Girl, You Don't Have To Be Hiding
 Don't You Be Ashamed To Say He Hurt You
 I'm Your Girl, You're My Girl, We're Your Girls
 Don't You To Know That We Love You?

 [Verse 2 Kelly]
 See What You All Don't Know About Him
 Is I Can't Let Him Go Because He Needs Me
 It Ain't Really Him It's Stress From His Job
 And I Ain't Making It Easy
 I Know You See Him Bugging On Me Sometimes
 But I Know Deep Inside He Don't Mean It
 It Gets Hard Sometimes
 But I Need My Man
 I Don't Think Ya'll Understand
 I'm Telling You

 [Chorus x2]

 [Bridge Michelle]
 Girl, Take A Good Look At Yourself
 He Got You Going Through Hell
 We Ain't Never Seen You Down Like This
 What You Mean You Don't Need Us To Help?
 We Known Each Other Too Well

 [Chorus:]

 [Beyonce:]
 Girl I've been knowin' you since you were ten,
 You cannot hide from your friends

 [Chorus:]
                        
                    |
