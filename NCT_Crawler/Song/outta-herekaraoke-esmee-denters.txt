                        Get me outta here
 'Cuz my eyes are burning
 From these silly tears
 That you brought when you show me you don't really care
 And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place
 Right now

 It's so amazing how you have so many faces
 And you are not that person I thought that
 I had fell so deep in love with

 You changed up your makeup your dna
 I can't recognize you're a stranger to me
 I feel so betrayed what a waste of my heart and me

 Get me outta here
 'Cuz my eyes are burning
 From these silly tears
 That you brought when you show me you don't really care
 And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place
 Right now

 My body's trembling it's so damn hard
 To kick this feeling, your heart is so cold and now I'm freezing
 Wish you could feel the pain, maybe I will arrange it
 Yeah yeah, yeah

 You changed up your makeup your dna
 I can't recognize, you're a stranger to me
 I feel so betrayed, what a waste of my heart and me

 Get me outta here
 'Cuz my eyes are burning
 From these silly tears
 That you brought when you show me you don't really care
 And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place

 I thought that we were forever
 I guess I misunderstood
 My fault for thinking you loved me
 Or in thinking you ever could
 Get me out of here right now
 Get me out of here right now

 Get me outta here
 'Cuz my eyes are burning
 From these silly tears
 That you brought when you show me you don't really care
 And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place

 Get me outta here
 'Cuz my eyes are burning
 From these silly tears
 That you brought when you show me you don't really care
 (You don't really care)
 And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place

 1, 2, 3, 4
 Right now, right now, right now
 Someone get me outta this place
 Right now, right now, right now
 Someone get me outta this place
 Get me outta here
