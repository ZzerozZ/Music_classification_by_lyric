                        In a sentimental mood I can see
 The stars come through my room
 While your loving attitude
 Is like a flame that lights the gloom On the wings of every kiss
 Drift a melody so strange and sweet
 In this sentimental bliss
 You make my paradise complete Rose petals seem to fall
 It's all like a dream to call you mine
 My heart's a lighter thing
 Since you made me this night a thing divine In a sentimental mood
 I'm within a world so heavenly
 For I never dreamt
 That you'd be loving sentimental me In a sentimental mood I can see
 The stars come through my room
 While your loving attitude
 Is like a flame that lights the gloom On the wings of every kiss
 Drift a melody so strange and sweet
 In this sentimental bliss
 You make my paradise complete Rose pearls seem to fall
 It's all like a dream to call you mine
 My heart's lighter thing
 Since you made me this night a thing divine In a sentimental mood
 I'm within a world so heavenly
 For I never dreamt
 That you'd be loving sentimental me
