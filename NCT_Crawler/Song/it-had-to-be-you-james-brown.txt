                        It had to be you, it had to be you
 I wandered around and finally found
 Somebody who could make me feel blue could make me be true
 And even be glad, just to be sad thinkin' of you

 Some others I've seen might never be mean
 Might never, ever be cross or try to be boss
 But they, they wouldn't do for nobody else gave me a thrill
 With all your faults baby, I love you still

 It had to be you, it had to be you, it had to be you
 It had to be you, it had to be you
 Wandered around and finally found
 Somebody who could make me feel blue, hey, could make me be true
 Even be glad, just to be sad thinkin' of you

 Some others I've seen, might never be mean, don't be so mean
 Might never be cross or try to be boss
 But they, they wouldn't do but nobody else gave me that look or thrill
 With all your faults woman, I love you still

 It had to be, it had to be, it had to be you, hey, hey
 It had to be you, it had to be you, hey
 I said, it had to be, it had to be, it had to be you
 You doggone, woman, you
