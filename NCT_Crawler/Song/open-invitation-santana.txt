                        You be you and let me be me
 No strings attached emotionally
 I wanna get a little crazy that's putting it plain
 You got the medicine and I got the pain When you just wanna feel good
 Like the doctor said
 One good dose of loving
 Is gonna straighten out your head You got an open invitation
 On that you can rely
 You got a prepaid reservation
 And that's the only way to fly Let's make love, the feeling is right
 Just passing by like ships in the night
 Oughta get a little friendly there's no time like now
 You bring the attitude and I'll show you how Anytime you're ready
 Anytime at all
 Just come on over
 You don't even have to call You got an open invitation
 On that you can rely
 You got a prepaid reservation
 That's the only way to fly When you just wanna feel good
 Like the doctor said
 One good dose of loving
 Is gonna straighten out your head You got an open invitation
 On that you can rely, oh my
 You got a prepaid reservation
 And that's the only way to fly
