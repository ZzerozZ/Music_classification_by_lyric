I see those tears in your eyes 
I feel so helpless inside 
Oh love, there's no need to hide 
Just let me love you when your heart is tired 

Cold hands, red eyes 
Packed your bags at midnight 
They've been there for weeks 
You don't know what goodbye means 

Just roll up a cigarette 
Just forget about this mess 
Been waiting on the sidelines 
From the sidelines 

I see those tears in your eyes 
And I feel so helpless inside 
Oh love, there's no need to hide 
Just let me love you when your heart is tired 

If your ghost pulls you up high 
And it feels like you've lost who you are 
My love, there's no need to hide 
Just let me love you when your heart is tired 

Just let me love you 
Just let me love you 
Just let me love you 
Just let me love you 
Just let me love you when your heart is tired 

And you whisper, I'm alright 
But I see through your white lies 
But these walls don’t talk 
And if they could, they’d say 

Can't hide the secrets 
You can't forget about this mess 
I'm waiting on the sidelines 
From the sidelines 

I see those tears in your eyes 
And I feel so helpless inside 
Oh love, there's no need to hide 
Just let me love you when your heart is tired 

If your ghost pulls you up high 
And it feels like you've lost who you are 
My love, there's no need to hide 
Just let me love you when your heart is tired 

Just let me love you 
Just let me love you 
Just let me love you 
Just let me love you 
Just let me love you when your heart is tired 

I see those tears in your eyes 
And I feel so helpless inside 
My love, there's no need to hide 
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
                        
                    |
