                        [Hook]
 I am a sinner
 Who is probably going to sin again
 Lord forgive me
 Lord forgive me
 Things I don't understand
 Sometimes I need to be alone
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 I can feel your energy from two planets away
 I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today yelling
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe [Verse 1]
 Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
 Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
 I can feel the changes
 I can feel a new life
 I always knew life can be dangerous
 I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
 You don't know what pain is
 How can I paint this picture
 When the color blind is hanging with ya
 Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
 Another mistake living deep in my heart
 Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
 I can admit that it did look like yours
 Why you resent every making of this
 Tell me your purpose is petty again
 But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
 Even a small lighter can burn a bridge [Hook]
 I can feel the changes
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
 You can see that my city found me put me on stages
 To me that's amazing
 To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this I am a human
 Who is probably going to fall again
 Lord forgive me
 Lord forgive me
 Things I don't understand
 Sometimes I need to be alone
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 I can feel your energy from two planets away
 I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe [Verse 2]
 I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
 You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
 And I'm looking right past ya
 We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
 You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
 I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
 This *** is vital, I know you had to
 This *** is vital, I know you had to
 Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
 Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
 Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
 On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
 Ima break out and then hide every lock
 Ima break out and then hide every lock [Hook]
 I can feel the changes
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
 You can see that my city found me put me on stages
 To me that's amazing
 To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this I am a sinner
 Who is probably gonna sin again
 Lord forgive me
 Lord forgive me
 Things I don't understand
 Sometimes I need to be alone
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 I can feel your energy from two planets away
 I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe [Bridge]
 You ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time
 Don't you see that long line
 And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
 3s in the air I can see you are - in sync
 Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
 I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
 My new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
 Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
 I say - Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
 Bitch don't kill my vibe
