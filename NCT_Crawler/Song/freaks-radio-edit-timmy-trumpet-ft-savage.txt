                        Bài hát: Freaks (Radio Edit) - Timmy Trumpet, Savage 

The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war! 
Ah, the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor! 
The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war! 
Ah, the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor! 

Tell me, tell me, where the freaks at! 
Tell me, tell me, where the freaks at, freaks at, freaks at, freaks at, freaks at, fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre 

Tell me where the freaks at!! 

We get that bass thumpin', people jumpin' all over the world 
We got them speakers pumpin', Timmy Trumpet for the woman with curves. 
Got that freak flow, freak show 
Welcome to the circus 
Let the leaders lead, preachers preach, 
Welcome to the service. 

Close the curtains on 'em if they're actin' like they never heard us 
See we do this for a purpose just to keep that fire burnin'. 
And we don't need no water let that mother-mother-burn, 
Timmy play your trumpet let the people go berserk. 

[Trumpet plays] 

The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war! 
Ah, the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor! 
The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war! 
Ah, the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor! 

Tell me, tell me, where the freaks at! 
Tell me, tell me, where the freaks at, freaks at, freaks at, freaks at, freaks at, fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre-fre 

Tell me where the freaks at!! 

The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war! 
Ah, the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor! 
The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war! 
Ah, the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor!
