                        The most beautiful sound I ever heard, Maria
 Maria, Maria, Maria
 All the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word, Maria
 Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria I've just met a girl named Maria
 And suddenly that name
 Will never be the same to me, Maria I've just kissed my child named Maria
 And suddenly I've found
 How wonderful a sound can be, Maria Say it loud and there's music playing
 Say it soft and it's almost like praying Maria, I'll never stop saying Maria Say it loud and there's music playing
 Say it soft and it's almost like praying Maria, I'll never stop saying Maria The most beautiful sound I ever heard, Maria
