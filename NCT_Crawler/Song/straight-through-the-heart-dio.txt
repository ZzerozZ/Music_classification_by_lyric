                        Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
 It looks like a long, long way to fall
 No one ever told me life was kind
 I guess I never heard it, never heard it all Living in a world of make believe
 I can hide behind what's real
 But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
 And they all know what you feel And here it comes again
 Straight through the heart
 Straight through the heart Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes
 It's the eyes that let you down
 Tell a little truth with many lies
 It's the only way I've found Oh here it comes again
 Straight through the heart
 Straight through the heart Shout to the wind
 How can you hurt me this way
 Oh once it begins
 It looks like it's coming to stay Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
 It looks like a long, long way to fall
 No one never told me life was kind
 I guess I never heard it, never heard it all, no But here it comes again
 Straight through the heart
 Straight through the heart
 Straight through the heart Here it comes again
 Straight through the heart
 In the middle of the heart
 Now don't stand still, they'll get you
 Right through your heart And here it comes, here it comes again
 Straight through the heart
