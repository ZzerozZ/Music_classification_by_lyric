                        [Nate]
 I was lonely,
 I needed someone, to see me threw,
 I was at the, end of my rope,
 I needed someone, to cut me lose
 Then an angel, out of the blue,
 Gave me the since that I, might make it through
 And somehow I survived, with no rhyme or reason,
 And now I know I'll make It,
 Through the miracle of you

 [Chorus]
 I know the Color Of Love,
 (And It lives in side of you)
 I know the color of truth,
 (Its in the image of you)
 If it comes for the heart, then you know that it's true,
 It will color your soul, like a rainbow
 (Like a rainbow)
 And the color of love, is in you

 [Shawn]
 Like a bridge,
 Over troubled, troubled water
 You stood beside me, stood beside me
 And your love, did not falter
 And then the angel, angel in you,
 Gave me the strength to know,
 That I will get through,
 And that's how I survived, ain't no other reason
 And now I know I'll make it, through the miracle of you

 [Chorus]

 [Bridge]

 [Wanya]
 So girl I want to thank you,
 I can't thank you enough,
 For showing me the meaning,
 The meaning of true love,
 (When I was lost and so in need you opened up your heart)
 (When I needed you to comfort me you opened up you arms)
 (I couldn't face another day you said don't be afraid)
 You showed my heart the, showed me the way

 [Chorus]

 [Wanya]
 Ohh, the color of you
                        
                    |
