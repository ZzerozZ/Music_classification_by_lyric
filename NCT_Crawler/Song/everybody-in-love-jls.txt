                        Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
 Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
 Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
 If you're in love, put your hands up You know you need someone when the need's so strong
 When they're gone you don't know how to go on
 So the whole world is stuck in a moment
 Standing still until they come back You accept that they've got things to do
 But sometimes in the end there's nothing left for you
 If hurt is missing your baby
 I've done too much of it lately 'Cause, every minute's like an hour, every hour's like a day
 Every day lasts forever, but what else am I gonna do?
 I'd wait forever and a day for you
 I'd wait up, wait up I can't eat, I can't sleep, what else could it be?
 Missing you so deep, long as I'm where you're going to
 I'd wait forever and a day for you
 I'd wait up, wait up for you
 I'd wait up, wait up for you And even when we mad and say we're through
 Deep inside you feel the same way I do
 Might as well turn around and just end this
 'Cause it's harder trying to stay mad I could tell you that you can't stay here
 Knowing just as soon as you disappear
 That I'll be missing you, baby
 Soon as you get up and you walk away Every minute's like an hour, every hour's like a day
 Every day lasts forever, but what else am I gonna do?
 I'd wait forever and a day for you
 I'd wait up, wait up I can't eat, I can't sleep, what else could it be?
 Missing you so deep, long as I'm where you're going to
 I'd wait forever and a day for you
 I'd wait up, wait up for you Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
 Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
 Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
 If you're in love, put your hands up
 (Put your hands up) Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
 (Up)
 Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
 (Love)
 Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
 (Up)
 If you're in love, put your hands up
 (Put your hands up) Every minute's like an hour, every hour's like a day
 Every day lasts forever, but what else am I gonna do?
 I'd wait forever and a day for you
 I'd wait up, wait up I can't eat, I can't sleep, what else could it be?
 Missing you so deep
 Long as I'm where you're going to
 I'd wait forever and a day for you
 I'd wait up, wait up for you
