                        Bài hát: What Do I Do With My Heart - Eagles

You don't have to say a word
I can see it in your eyes
I know what you wanna say
It's so hard to say goodbye
I can hold back my tears

And try to be strong
While our love is fallin' apart
I know what I'll say
If you walk away
But what do I do

What do I do with my heart?
I'm not gonna say a word
I know I can't change your mind
You know where you need to go
I know I'll be left behind

I won't hold you back
I won't stand in your way
If you need to make a new start
But I still wanna know

When my arms let you go
What do I do
What do I do with my heart?
Oh, girl, don't you remember?
It was not so long ago
We were makin' plans for two

Just me and you
Now you tell me that you've found somebody
Someone who loves you better
No one could ever love you
The way I do
Tell me you're not leavin' now

Tell me you're not leavin'
Tell me that you're gonna stay
Please say you'll stay with me, baby
Tell me that you love me still
Say you love me still
For this and this alone I pray
Fall down on my knees and pray

I'll do anything
Yes, I would
To save what we have
To keep you by my side
I'll love you 'til death do us part

But what do I do
What do I do
When I'm still missing you?
What do I do
What do I do with my heart?
                        
                    |
