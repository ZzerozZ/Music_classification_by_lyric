                        What about your friends?
 What about?
 What about your friends?
 What about, what about? Every now and then I get a little crazy
 That's not the way it's supposed to be
 Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
 I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah People try to say I act a little funny
 But that's just a figure of speech to me
 They tell me I changed because I got money
 But if you were there before then you're still down with me What about your friends?
 Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
 What about your friends?
 Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
 Or will they turn their backs on you Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too friendly
 So to speak hypothetically say I supply creativity
 To what others must take as a form of self-hate
 Only to make an enemy which results in unfortunate destiny
 They dog me out then be next to me
 Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy Every now and then I get a little easy
 I let a lot of people depend on me
 I never thought they would ever deceive me
 Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own? I'll never let another get that close to me
 You see I've grown a lot smarter now
 Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
 If your friend is true they'll be there with you through the thick and thin What about your friends?
 Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
 What about your friends?
 Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
 Or will they turn their backs on you Yo, this is me, well is it me or can it be I'm a little too friendly
 So to speak hypothetically say I supply creativity
 To what others must take as a form of self-hate
 Only to make an enemy which results in unfortunate destiny
 They dog me out then be next to me
 Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy What about your friends?
 Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
 What about your friends?
 Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
 Or will they turn their backs on you People say I act a little funny, I wouldn't change not for no money
 I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me, yeah, yeah
 Even though I might seem easy, it don't give you no cause to deceive me
 It's not the way I want my friends to ever be What about your friends?
 Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
 What about your friends?
 Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
 Or will they turn their backs on you What about your friends?
 Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
 What about your friends?
 Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
 Or will they turn their backs on you
