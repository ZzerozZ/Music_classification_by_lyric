                        Bài hát: True Friends - Bring Me The Horizon

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?

It's funny how things work out
Such a bitter irony
Like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart right from the start
But I couldn't even see the forest for the trees
(I'm afraid you asked for this)

You've got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart & there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

It's kind of sad cause what we had
Well it could have been something
I guess it wasn't meant to be
(So how dare you) Try and steal my flame
Just cause yours faded
Well hate is gasoline
A fire fuelling all my dreams
(I'm afraid you asked for this)

You've got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart & there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

You can run, but you can't hide
Time won't help you
Cause karma has no deadline
You can run, but you can't hide
Time won't help you
Cause karma has no deadline

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart & there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
