                        Song: Everlong
 Artist: Foo Fighters
Hello
I've waited here for you .....
Everlong
Tonight
I throw myself into .....
And out of the red, 
out of her head she sang

Come down
And waste away with me ... ..
Down with me .. ....
Slow how
You wanted it to be ... ....
I'm over my head, 
out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you

If everything could ever feel this real forever

If anything could ever be this good again

The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when

She sang

Breathe out
So I could breathe you in .. ....
Hold you in
And now
I know you've always been ... ..
Out of your head, 
out of my head I sang

And I wonder

When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever

If anything could ever be this good again

The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when

She sang
