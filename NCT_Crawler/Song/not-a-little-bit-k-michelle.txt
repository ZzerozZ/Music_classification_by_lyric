                        Bài hát: Not A Little Bit - K. Michelle

[Verse 1]
How'd I believe that this time would be different?
How'd I believe that you changed?
I wanted too much so I said I could take it
But I couldn't handle the strain
Tryna be who you want me to be, yeah
Tryna make it okay
Tryna look at myself in the mirror
I couldn't go on that way

[Pre-Chorus]
It's gonna take a miracle this time
To make me change my mind
I'm alone and doing fine
So I leave it all behind

[Chorus]
If you think I want you, not a little bit
If you think I need you, not a little bit
I finally moved on I'm over it
If you think I need you, not
Think I need you, not
If you think I want you, not a little bit
If you think I need you, not a little bit
I finally moved on I'm over it
If you think I need you, not
Think I need you, not

[Verse 2]
A love unconditional, love with no limits
A love that let's me be myself
I love me forever with no competition
There's nothing and nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
It's gonna take a miracle this time
To make me change my mind
I'm alone and doing fine
So I leave it all behind

[Chorus]
If you think I want you, not a little bit
If you think I need you, not a little bit
I finally moved on I'm over it
If you think I need you, not
Think I need you, not
If you think I want you, not a little bit
If you think I need you, not a little bit
I finally moved on I'm over it
If you think I need you, not
Think I need you, not

[Bridge]
And there's nothing left to say
(Nothing to say, nothing to say)
Going back was my mistake
(Going back was my mistake)
And there can be no more next time
(There's no next time)
You're out of my life

[Chorus]
If you think I want you, not a little bit
If you think I need you, not a little bit
I finally moved on I'm over it
If you think I need you, not
Think I need you, not
If you think I want you, not a little bit
If you think I need you, not a little bit
I finally moved on I'm over it
If you think I need you, not
Think I need you, not
If you think I want you, not a little bit
If you think I need you, not a little bit
I finally moved on I'm over it
If you think I need you, not
Think I need you, not...
