                        Bài hát : Not About Angels - Birdy

We know full well there's just time
So is it wrong to toss this line
If your heart was full of love
Could you give it up?

'Cause what about, what about angels
They will come, they will go make us special
Don't give me up
Don't give me up

How unfair, it's just our luck
Found something real that's out of touch
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
Would you dare to let it go?

'Coz what about, what about angels
They will come, they will go make us special
Don't give me up
Don't give me up

'Coz what about, what about angels
They will come, they will go make us special

It's not about not about angels, angels
                        
                    |
