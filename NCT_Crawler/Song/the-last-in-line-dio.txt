                        Bài hát : The Last In Line - Dio

We're a ship without a storm the cold without the warm light inside the darkness that it needs yeah
We're a laugh without a tear the hope without the fear we are coming home
We're off to the witch we may never never never come home but the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross the throw before the toss you can release yourself but the only way is down
We don't come alone we are fire we are stone we're the hand that writes then quickly moves away
We'll know for the first time if we're evil or divine we're the last in line yeah we're the last in line
Two eyes from the east it's the angel or the beast and the answer lies between the good and bad
We search for the truth we could die upon the tooth but the thrill of just the chase is worth the pain
We'll know for the first time if we're evil or divine we're the last in line yeah we're the last in line oh oh oh
Yeah we're off to the witch we may never never never come home but the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross you know we'rethe throw before the toss 
You can release yourself but the only way you go is down
We'll know for the first time if we're evil or divine we're the last in line oh oh we're the last in line
See all we shine we're the last in we're the last in we're the last in we're the last in
We're the last in we're the last line oh oh ooh oh 
We're the ship without the storm we're the cold inside the warm 
We're the last without a tear we're the throw without the meal
We're the last in line we're the last in line 
We're the last in line see how we shine we're the last in line
