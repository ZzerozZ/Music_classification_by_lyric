                        There's a guy, I want you to know
 He's the guy, I love so
 He's my Teddy, oh Teddy
 I, I love him so Oh, I remember the day that we met
 I'd be so silly to ever forget
 Woo Teddy, oh Teddy
 I, I love him so Ohh, he is so shy, it doesn't matter
 You're my guy, can't you see
 That I want you, I need you, I love you, I do
 And you belong to me I'll always love you, the rest of my life
 We could get married, I'd be your wife
 Woo Teddy, oh Teddy
 I, I love you so I'll always love you, the rest of my life
 We could get married, I'd be your wife
 Woo Teddy, oh Teddy
 I, I love you so
