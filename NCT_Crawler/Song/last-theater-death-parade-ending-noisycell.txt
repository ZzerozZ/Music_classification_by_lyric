I’m not gonna make it
Is it almost over now?
Can’t see the way
Run down


I can’t understand how this chain reaction
Has brought me to the edge I’m looking down
One more step would it make me free?
I could fall into the darkness
Realize that I’m just so afraid


“I don’t want to destroy life”
Remember...
“I know you want to”
“it’s alright”
Remember...


I’m not gonna make it
Is it almost over now?
Can’t see the way to go
I feel so alone
My blood is on the ground
This time I lost control


I gave up my thoughts
Lived just by reaction
Made nothing but a fake, empty escape
“Be true to yourself”
I’ve heard enough of that
I know if I remember
I’ll find the good
I don’t care


“I don’t want to destroy life”
Remember...
“I know you want to” (I don’t know)
“it’s alright” (It’s not alright)
Remember... (You think you know?)
I still believe
I still believe in myself


I’m not gonna make it
Is it almost over now?
Can’t see the way to go
I feel so alone
My blood is on the ground
I can’t forgive this anymore


I just wanna make it
If it’s almost over now
Can’t see the way to go
I feel so alone
My blood is on the ground
I can’t forgive this anymore


Who chooses what is right?
No one can begin to say
So will you turn around
Or will you fade away?


My heart is crying out
I may never see
But still I have to go
I have to go
                        
                    |
