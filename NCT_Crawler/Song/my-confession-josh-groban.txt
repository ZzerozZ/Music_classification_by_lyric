                        I have been blind, unwilling to see
The true love you're giving.
I have ignored every blessing.
I'm on my knees confessing

That I feel myself surrender
Each time I see your face.
I am staggered by your beauty,
Your unassuming grace.
And I feel my heart is turning,
Falling into place.
I can't hide
Now hear my confession.

I have been wrong about you.
Thought I was strong without you.
For so long nothing could move me.
For so long nothing could change me.
Now I feel myself surrender
Each time I see your face.
I am captured by your beauty,
Your unassuming grace.
And I feel my heart is turning,
Falling into place.
I can't hide
Now hear my confession.

[bridge:]
You are the air that I breath.
You're the ground beneath my feet.
When did I stop believing?

Cause I feel myself surrender 
Each time I see your face.
I am staggered by your beauty,
Your unassuming grace.
And I feel my heart 
Falling into place.
I can't hide
Now hear my confession.
I can't hide
Now hear my confession.
Hear my confession
                        
                    |
