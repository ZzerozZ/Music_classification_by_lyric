                        Bài hát: East Of Eden - Zella Day

Pink toes pressed against the carpet
Show your face and finish what you started
The record spins down the alley late night
Be my friend, surround me like a satellite

Tiger on the prowl
EAST OF EDEN
Coming for you now

Keep me from the cages under the control
Running in the dark to find East of Eden
Keep me from the cages under the control
Running in the dark to find East of Eden

TO FIND EAST OF EDEN
TO FIND EAST OF EDEN
TO FIND EAST OF EDEN
TO FIND EAST OF EDEN

Call me wild, drinking up the sunshine
Be my man and show me what it feels like
Darkened sky unbuttoned down the middle
Spilling out little by little

Tiger on the prowl
EAST OF EDEN
Coming for you now

Keep me from the cages under the control
Running in the dark to find East of Eden
Keep me from the cages under the control
Running in the dark to find East of Eden

TO FIND EAST OF EDEN
TO FIND EAST OF EDEN
TO FIND EAST OF EDEN
TO FIND EAST OF EDEN

If I wanted to stay
You don't mind, you're a true believer
Take it up with the bad man
Scribbling like the concrete fever

If I wanted to stay
You don't mind, you're a true believer
Take it up with the bad man
Scribbling like the concrete fever

Keep me from the cages under the control
Running in the dark to find East of Eden
Keep me from the cages under the control
Running in the dark to find East of Eden

TO FIND EAST OF EDEN
TO FIND EAST OF EDEN
TO FIND EAST OF EDEN
TO FIND EAST OF EDEN
