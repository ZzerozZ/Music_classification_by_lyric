                        Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
 Your rolled up sleeves in your skull t-shirt
 You say what did you do with him today?
 And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray

 Cause you're my fella, my guy
 Hand me your stella and fly
 By the time I'm out the door
 You tear men down like roger moore

 I cheated myself
 Like I knew I would
 I told ya, I was trouble
 You know that I'm no good

 Upstairs in bed, with my ex boy
 He's in a place, but I can't get joy
 Thinking of you in the final throws, this is when my buzzer goes

 Run out to meet you, chips and pitter
 You say when we're married cause you're not bitter
 There'll be none of him no more
 I cried for you on the kitchen floor

 I cheated myself
 Like I knew I would
 I told ya, I was trouble
 You know that I'm no good

 Sweet reunion, Jamaica and spain
 We're like how we were again
 I'm in the tub you on the seat
 Lick your lips as I soak my feet

 Then you notice little carpet burns
 My stomach drops and my guts churn
 You shrug and it's the worst
 To truly stuck the knife in first

 I cheated myself like I knew I would
 I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
 I cheated myself, like I knew I would
 I told ya I was trouble, yeah ya know that I'm no good
