I wanna bring it back, We never carry on
I wanna bring it back, We never carry on
Seize it somehow seize it somehow
Only thing I lose

We hurry on ( Yeah ! ), 'cuz we are coming to the end
I know it's me I could me one from millions
I never trust anything to survive

No ,no ,that's all, I'll be all right
No ,no ,that's why you take me back
No ,no ,that's the price I must pay?
I've got leave you nothing to take anymore

Watch it watch it, make me feel like the man
