                        Bài hát: See You Again (DJ Zin Xu, DJ Banana Remix 2016) - Miley Cyrus

I've got my sight set on you, 
And I'm ready to aim, 
I have a heart that will, 
Never be tamed, 
I knew you were something special 
When you spoke my name, 
Now I can't wait, to see you again... 

I've got a way of knowing, 
When something is right, 
I feel like I must have known you, 
In another life, 
Cause I felt this deep connection, 
When you looked in my eyes, 
Now I can't wait to see you again, 

The last time I freaked out, 
I just kept looking down, 
I st-st-stuttered when 
You asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout 
Felt like I couldn't breathe 
You asked what's wrong with me 
My best friend Lesley said: 
"Oh she's just being Miley!" 

The next time we hang out, 
I will redeem myself, 
My heart can't rest till then, 
Whoa! Whoa! I, 
I can't wait to see you again, 

I got this crazy feeling 
Deep inside 
When you called and asked to see me 
Tomorrow night, 
I'm not a mind reader, 
But I'm reading the signs 
That you can't wait to see me again 

The last time I freaked out, 
I just kept looking down, 
I st-st-stuttered when 
You asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout 
Felt like I couldn't breathe, 
You asked what's wrong with me, 
My best friend Lesley said: 
"She's just being Miley!" 

The next time we hang out, 
I will redeem myself 
My heart can't rest till then, 
Whoa! Whoa! I, 
I can't wait to see you again, 

I've got my sight set on you, 
And I'm ready to aim, 

The last time I freaked out, 
I just kept looking down, 
I st-st-stuttered when 
You asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout 
Felt like I couldn't breathe, 
You asked what's wrong with me, 
My best friend Lesley said: 
"She's just being Miley" 

The next time we hang out, 
I will redeem myself 
My heart can't rest till then, 
Whoa! Whoa! I, 
I can't wait to see you again, 
Whoa! Whoa! I, 
I can't wait to see you again.
