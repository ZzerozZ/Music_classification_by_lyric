                        Beautiful girls all over the world 
i could be chasing but my time would be wasted 
they got nothing on you baby 
nothing on you baby 
they might say hi and i might say hey 
but you shouldn't worry about what they say 
cause they got nothing on you baby 
nothing on you baby 

not not not nothing on you babe 
not not nothing on you 
i know you feel where i'm coming from 
regardless of the things in my past that i've done 
most of it really was for the hell of the fun 
on the carousel so around i spun (spun) 
with no directions just tryna get some (some) 
tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun) 
this is how i lost more than i had ever won 
and honestly i ended up with none 

there's no much nonsense 
it's on my conscience 
i'm thinking baby i should get it out 
and i don't wanna sound redundant 
but i was wondering if there was something that you wanna know 
(that you wanna know) 
but never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go) 
cos we don't wanna be a t.v episode (t.v episode) 
and all the bad thoughts just let them go (go, go, go, go)

and you wild when you ain't got nothing on

and you keep it real while them other stay plastic

i've been to london, i've been to paris 
even way out there in tokyo 
back home down in georgia to new orleans 
but you always steal the show (steal the show) 
and just like that girl you got me froze (got me froze)
