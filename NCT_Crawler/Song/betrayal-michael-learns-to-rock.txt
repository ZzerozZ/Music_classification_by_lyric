                        My love has gone away, 
quietly after a hundered days. 
This is what's she has always said she won't stay 
for more than what she can repay. 

I can still hear her say there 
that I'm not hearing tender play 
The day she let me kiss her was a display, 
of love to those who she betray. 

How can I put someone to the test, 
when I thought I got the best. 
Untill the taste of bitterness then I regret 
but still that I won't detest, 
the love I can't forget, 
like someone who has left. 

How can i leave someone for the rest 
when i'm alone facing the best 
Untill they take some try to reason i regret 
But still that i won't detest 
who i can never forget 
like someone i once met ..
