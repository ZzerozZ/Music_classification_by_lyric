                        Who's to know if your soul will fade at all
 The one you sold to fool the world
 You lost your self-esteem along the way
 Yeah Good god your comin' up with reasons
 Good god your dragging it out
 Good god its the changing of the seasons
 I feel so raped
 So follow me down And just fake it if your out of direction
 Fake it if you don't belong
 Fake it if you feel like a infection
 Woah your such a fuckin' hypocrite And you should know that the lies wont hide your falls
 No sense in hiding all of yours
 You gave up on your dreams along the way
 Yeah Good god your comin' up with reasons
 Good god your dragging it out
 Good god its the changing of the seasons
 I feel so raped
 So follow me down And just fake it if your out of direction
 Fake it if you don't belong
 Fake it if you feel like a infection Woah your such a fuckin' hypocrite Whoah whoah I can fake with the best of anyone
 I can fake with the best of em all
 I can fake with the best of anyone
 I can fake it all Who's to know if your soul will fade at all
 The one you sold to fool the world
 You lost your self-esteem along the way
 Yeah Good god your comin' up with reasons
 Good god your dragging it out
 Good god its the changing of the seasons
 I feel so raped
 So follow me down And just fake it if your out of direction
 Fake it if you don't belong
 Fake it if you feel like a infection
 Woah your such a fuckin' hypocrite Fake it if your out of direction
 Fake it if you don't belong
 Fake it if you feel like a infection
 Woah your such a fuckin' hypocrite
