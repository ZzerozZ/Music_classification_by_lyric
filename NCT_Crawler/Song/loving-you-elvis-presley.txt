                        Bài hát: Loving You - Elvis Presley

I will spend my whole life through
 Loving you, just loving you
 Winter, summer, springtime, too
 Loving you, loving you
 Makes no difference where I go or what I do
 You know that I'll always be loving you
 Just you and
 If I'm seen with someone new
 Don't be blue, don't you be blue
 I'll be faithful, I'll be true
 Always true, true to you
 There is only one for me
 And you know who
 You know that I'll always be
 Loving you
