                        All I know
 Is everything is not as it's sold
 But the more I grow the less I know
 And I have lived so many lives
 Though I'm not old
 And the more I see, the less I grow
 The fewer the seeds the more I sow

 Then I see you standing there
 Wanting more from me
 And all I can do is try
 Then I see you standing there
 Wanting more from me
 And all I can do is try

 I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
 And all the real people are really not real at all
 The more I learn The more I learn
 The more I cry the more I cry
 As I say goodbye to the way of life
 I thought I had designed for me

 Then I see you standing there
 Wanting more from me
 And all I can do is try
 Then I see you standing there
 I'm all I'll ever be
 But all I can do is try
 Try

 All of the moments that already passed
 We'll try to go back and make them last
 All of the things we want each other to be
 We never will be
 And that's wonderful, and that's life
 And that's you, baby
 This is me, baby
 And we are, we are, we are, we are
 Free
 In our love
 We are free in our love
                        
                    |
