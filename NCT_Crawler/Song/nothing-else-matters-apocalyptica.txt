                        So close no matter how far
 Couldn't be much more from the heart
 Forever trusting who we are
 'Cuz nothing else matters Never opened myself this way
 Life is ours, we do it our way
 All these words I just don't say
 'Cuz nothing else matters Never cared for what they do, no
 Never cared for what they know, no
 But I know So close, no matter how far
 Couldn't be much more from the heart
 Forever trusting who we are
 'Cuz nothing else matters Never cared for what they do, no
 Never cared for what they know, no
 Never cared for what they do, no
 But I know Trust I seek but I find in you
 Every day for us something new
 Open mind for a different view
 'Cuz nothing else matters, oh So close, no matter how far
 Couldn't be much more from the heart
 Forever trusting who we are
 'Cuz nothing else matters
 'Cuz nothing else matters
