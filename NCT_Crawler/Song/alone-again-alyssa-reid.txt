                        Til now, I always got by on my own
 I never really cared until I met you
 And now it chills me to the bone
 How do I get you alone? I sit back and reminisce
 It hurts to think about it all
 We was on top of the world
 Whoever thought that we would fall? Standing by the phone
 Alone, ignoring your call
 I feel like spider man
 You got me flying off of the wall I ain't wanna leave
 But still I had to go
 'Cause what good is a rainbow
 Without my pot of gold? And now your beds empty
 And your pillow's cold
 You never realized the love
 Until my love was gone, yeah When you said I could move on and go
 You said I'm weak and it shows
 I couldn't go on without you Now I'm sitting in this house alone
 Wondering why I left home
 And I'm hoping that you know that Til now, I always got by on my own
 I never really cared until I met you (Til I met you)
 And now it chills me to the bone
 How do I get you alone? The phone call
 Can you stop the free fall?
 Can you be the reason
 I can see beyond the lies
 If I keep holding on? I hear you (Hear you)
 Can you stop the screaming? (Screaming)
 Did you stop believing?
 I could feel you letting go
 I can't be alone tonight When you said I could move on and go
 You said I'm weak and it shows
 I couldn't go on without you Now I'm sitting in this house alone
 Wondering why I left home
 And I'm hoping that you know that Til now, I always got by on my own
 I never really cared until I met you
 (Til I met you)
 And now it chills me to the bone
 How do I get you alone?
 How do I get you alone? I wonder where you are tonight
 No answer on the telephone
 And the night goes by so very slow
 Whoa, I hope that it won't end though, alone And I'm hoping that you know that Til now, I always got by on my own
 I never really cared until I met you
 (Til I met you)
 And now it chills me to the bone
 How do I get you alone? Til now, I always got by on my own
 I never really cared until I met you (Til I met you)
 And now it chills me to the bone
 How do I get you alone?
 How do I get you alone?
