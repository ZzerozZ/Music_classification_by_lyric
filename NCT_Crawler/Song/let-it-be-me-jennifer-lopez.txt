                        Bài hát: Let It Be Me - Jennifer Lopez

If the day comes that you must leave.
Let me be the ground to your feet.
If the day comes that you feel weak.
Let me be the armor you need.
Oh, if falling in love is a crime.
And the price to pay is my life.
Give me the sword, bring all the knives.
Hand me the gun, I will not run.
And when they spare everything but my pride.
Don't you worry, boy, don't you cry.
But when they ask
Who was the one?, who did you love?,
Let it be me.

If you ever meet your last breath.
Let me be the last word you said.
And if right comes, but you choose left.
I will be the first to forgive.
Oh, if heaven is a beautiful place.
But those gates don't have enough space.
They lock you out.
Spare you no flame.
I will come down.
If they're on my wings.
And when the angels call me a fool.
For giving all my grace up for you.
I won't look back.
But when they ask, who did you love?,
Let it be me.

Let it be me that you think of
When everything tells you to give it up.
Let it be me that will anchor your soul.
Until the clouds fall out of the sky.
And the snow fall down in July.
Let it be me, that you think of.
Let it be me, the one that you love.
Until the flowers don't bloom in May.
And forever runs out of days.
Let it be me
Let it be me
The one that you love
Let it be me

Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
Be me...
Oh let it be me
                        
                    |
