                        We have the chance to turn the pages over
 We can write what we want to write
 We gotta make ends meet, before we get much older We're all someone's daughter
 We're all someone's son
 How long can we look at each other
 Down the barrel of a gun? You're the voice, try and understand it
 Make the noise and make it clear, oh, woah
 We're not gonna sit in silence
 We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah This time, we know we all can stand together
 With the power to be powerful
 Believing we can make it better Ooh, we're all someone's daughter
 We're all someone's son, oh
 Give a look at each other
 Down the barrel of a gun You're the voice, try and understand it
 Make the noise and make it clear, oh, woah
 We're not gonna sit in silence
 We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah Ooh, we're all someone's daughter
 We're all someone's son
 How long can we look at each other
 Down the barrel of a gun? You're the voice, try and understand it
 Make the noise and make it clear, oh, woah
 We're not gonna sit in silence
 We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah You're the voice, try and understand it
 Make the noise and make it clear, oh, woah
 We're not gonna sit in silence
 We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah You're the voice, try and understand it
 Make the noise and make it clear, oh, woah
 We're not gonna sit in silence
 We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah You're the voice, try and understand it
 Make the noise and make it clear, oh, woah
 We're not gonna sit in silence
 We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah
