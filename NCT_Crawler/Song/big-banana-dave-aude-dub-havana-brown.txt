                        Dj Havana Brown, you crazy?
 Better answer the question now
 Talk to me
 Let's go

 Thicker than a Magnum, ace of spades
 Strong light, we can play charades
 My pants keepin' these
 Bananas, clips, shoot for days

 Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 What?
 That big fat...

 I'm goin' out tonight
 Got a gun, I don't want to fight
 I'm a hot girl, I have a right
 Heave a right, have a right
 Kill a guy hard I'mma call you bruised
 Feel dropped out and I'mma call you Cruise
 Beat it up up up, pop the juice
 Pop the juice, pop the juice

 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana

 If you want that, baby I got it

 Gi-gi-gi-give me
 Gi-gi-gi-give me
 Gi-gi-gi-give me
 That big fat...

 If you *** don't matter black or white
 Let me shake the uh then flip the light
 Let 'em all bark, I love to bite
 Love to bite, love to bite
 Getting tipsy, ain't getting loose
 I got the vibe, they got the juice
 Beat it up up up, pop the juice
 Pop the juice, pop the juice

 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana

 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana

 Do you have a big banana?
 If you want that, baby I got it
 (Gi-gi-gi-give me) Let's go
 (Gi-gi-gi-give me) Let's go
 That big fat...
 (Gi-gi-gi-give me) Let's go
 (Gi-gi-gi-give me) Let's go
 (Gi-gi-gi-give me) Let's go
 That big fat...

 Let's go go, she don't know
 Underneath the belt and the Polo
 Thicker than a trunk on a Volvo
 Automat black with the Rolls go

 Let's go go, she don't know
 Underneath the belt and the Polo
 Thicker than a trunk on a Volvo
 Automat black with the Rolls go
