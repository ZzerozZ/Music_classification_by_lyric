                        Bài hát: Miracle (Radio Mix) - Cascada

Boy meets girl
You were my dream, my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind
So on my own
I feel so all alone
Though I know it's true
I'm still in love with you

I need a miracle
I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see
That you are made for me
I need a miracle
Please let me be your girl
One day you'll see
It can happen to me
I need a miracle
I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see
That you are made for me
I need a miracle
Please let me be your girl
One day you'll see
It can happen to me
It can happen to me

Day and night
I'm always by your side
'Cause I know for sure
My love is real my feelings pure
So take a try
No need to ask me why
'Cause I know it's true
I'm still in love with you

I need a miracle
I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see
That you are made for me
I need a miracle
Please let me be your girl
One day you'll see
It can happen to me
I need a miracle
I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see
That you are made for me
I need a miracle
Please let me be your girl
One day you'll see
It can happen to me
It can happen to me
