                        I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say
 I thought I'd leave you with a letter or fiery speech
 Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play And I've been dying for hours
 Trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
 I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away?
 I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant Well I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around
 With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
 We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
 Now the guns are exhausted, the bullets are blanks
 And every thing's blank If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
 If I could only find a voice I would speak
 Oh it's there in my eyes, oh can't you see me tonight
 C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
 If I could only find a voice I would speak
 Oh it's there in my eyes, oh can't you see me tonight
 C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep I've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up to a scream
 We let the past slip away and put the future on hold
 Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream And I've been dying for hours
 Trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
 I'd like to know why you faded and you threw it away
 I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant Well I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around
 With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
 But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark
 The guns are exhausted
 And the bullets are blanks and every thing's blank If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
 If I could only find a voice I would speak
 Oh it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight
 C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep Oh it's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
 It's running silent and angry and deep
 Oh it's there in my eyes and it's all I can say
 C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep For all the hours we've been spending alone
 For the dreams we'll ignore
 And all those promises we promised to keep
 They won't be kept anymore For the magic that are bodies had made
 For the love that we lost
 And all the secrets that we somehow betrayed
 For whatever the cost For the memories still alive in our head
 For the lies we believe
 And all the things that can never be said
 Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep?
 C'mon and look at me and read 'em and It's there in my heart, it's all I can say
 C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep
