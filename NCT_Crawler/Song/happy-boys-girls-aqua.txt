 I'd rather stay here all the night with happy boys who sings
 Come on, let's go get it on, everybody, let's go have some fun
 I got a feeling you could use a little smile
 Hoping you could stay there for just a little while
 Making a lotta noise up there, throw your hands up in the air
 I don't wanna waste my time on simple little things

 Hoping you could stay there for just a little while
 Makin' a lotta noise up there, throw your hands up in the air
