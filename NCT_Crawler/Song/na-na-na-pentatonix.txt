                        Bài hát: Na Na Na - Pentatonix

Wont go whistling like the wind blows, 
Looking out my window, 
Just to see the shine 

Maybe you might call it crazy,
How Im acting lately,
Skipping through the sky

I see so clearly,
Why Im always feeling free.
So I sleep when my dreams,
Looking like reality

(Gonna feel it! Na na na...) x4

Gonna feel it!

I know where the greener grass grows 
Youll just have to follow
To the other side

Lets go tiptoe on a tight rope,
Fallings only natural
Just spread your wings and fly

Youll see so clearly,
Why Im always feeling free.
So I sleep when our dreams
Looking like reality

(Gonna feel it! Na na na...) x4

Bring it down like
Ohh way oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Break it down like
Ohh way oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
All around like
Ohh way oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Sing it loud like!
Ohh way oh
Ah oo oo ooo

Gonna feel it! (Na na na...)
Make it sound like! (Na na na...)
All around like! (Na na na...)
Sing it loud like! (Na na na...)
Gonna feel like! (Na na na...)
