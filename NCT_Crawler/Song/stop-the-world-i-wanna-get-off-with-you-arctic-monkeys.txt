                        Bài hát: Stop The World I Wanna Get Off With You - Arctic Monkeys

Open sesame, (we've places to go)
We've people to see (let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes, that I bet you can make
When you want to escape say the word.
Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room,

And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth.
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you.
Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you.
Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you.

Eyes the color of, (water left in?)
Ice and sugar dust. (crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing, that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?
Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you.

Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you.
Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie, and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see

Think we both oughta put 'em on hold and I know you agree
Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you
Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you
