[Justin Bieber]
Throwing up a G note
Like I'm at a casino
I'm all fancy yeah I'm popping pellegrino
I'm in the El Camino when I pull up on the scene-o
You know I'm a real OG and baby I ain't from the T.O.
You messing with the clique though
Meet me on the 6th floor
Know you ain't a model
You should let me take some pics doe (doe), aha
Windows down, speakers loud
Look down at my sneakers now
Got so many features
Tell the creatures just to beat it now
I'm 50 for the necklace
Look down at my set list
Gotcha girlfriend at my crib
Watching Netflix,
Let's just admit that I'm the bestest, guess this
You ain't never ever on the guest list

[Juicy J]
Yessir
Ass everywhere
Throw them dollars in the air
Bring you swimming gear
Juicy J the millionaire
She pop that pussy on me
I fell back in the chair
Bands a make her dance
Molly make her lose them underwear
Booty cheeks, I'm geeked (you know it)
All her friends are freaks (you know it)
And I think she love me
I've been hitting it for a week (swish)
I drill it, slap it silly
Need a super freak like Ricky
I'm Rick James bitch
I slip myself a Mickey
Got so much money in my pocket
With a real bad chick from the tropics
With silicone racks with a real big ass
Make her bounce it like hydraulics
Kept it hard, I got purple on the plane (we smoking)
Let's call a bull (let's go),
Let's run a train (trippy)

She say she love my lolly
She wanna make it pop (hey, girl)
She say she love my lolly
She wanna kiss the top (hey)

She love my lollipop (hey, girl)
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my lolly

Girl, I love them heels
And, yeah, I love that dress (hey, girl)
I wanna take you home
And show you I'm the best (hey)

She say she love my lolly
She love my lollipop (hey, girl)
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my lolly
