                        Luck be a lady tonight
 Luck be a lady tonight
 Luck if you've been a lady to begin with
 Luck be a lady tonight Luck let a gentleman see
 Just how nice a dame you can be
 I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
 Luck be a lady with me A lady never leaves her escort
 It isn't fair, it isn't nice
 A lady doesn't wander all over the room
 And blow on some other guys dice Lets keep this party polite
 Never get out of my sight
 Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
 Luck be a lady tonight
