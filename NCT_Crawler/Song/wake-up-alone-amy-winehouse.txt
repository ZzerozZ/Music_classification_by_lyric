                        Bài hát: Wake Up Alone - Amy Winehouse

It's okay in the day, I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying, so just lately
When I catch myself I do a 180

I stay up, clean the house, at least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets
His face in my dreams seizes my guts
He floods me with dread

Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him, moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

As was as my heart I'd rather be restless
The second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
This ache in my chest, 'cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now

My blood running cold, I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him
And he comes to me, I drip for him tonight
Drowning me, we bathe under blue light

His face in my dreams seizes my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in soul, he swims in my ice by the bed
Pour myself over him, moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
                        
                    |
