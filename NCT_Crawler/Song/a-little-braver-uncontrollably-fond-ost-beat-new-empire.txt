                        Bài hát : A Little Braver (Uncontrollably Fond Ost) Beat - New Empire

With december comes the glimmer on her face
And I get a bit nervous 
I get a bit nervous now
In the twelve months on I won't make friends with change 
When everyone's perfect can we start over again
The playgrounds they get rusty and your 
Heart beats another ten thousand times before
I got the chance to say I miss you

When it gets hard 
I get a little stronger now I get a little braver now

And when it gets dark I get a little brighter now 
I get a little wiser now before I give my heart away

Well we met each other at the house of runaways 
I remember it perfectly we were running on honesty 
We moved together like a silver lock and key
But now that your lock has changed 
I know I can't fit that way

The playgrounds they get rusty and your 
Heart beats another ten thousand times before
I got the chance to say I want you

When it gets hard
I get a little stronger now I get a little braver now

And when it gets dark I get a little brighter now 
I get a little wiser now before I give my heart away

When it gets hard
I get a little stronger now I get a little braver now

And when it gets dark I get a little brighter now 
I get a little wiser now before I give my heart away
                        
                    |
