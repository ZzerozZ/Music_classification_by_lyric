                        This town is a lonely town
 Not the only town like-a this town
 This town is a make you town
 Or a break you town and bring you down town This town is a quiet town
 Or a riot town like this town
 This town is a love you town
 And a shove you down and push you 'round town This town is an all right town
 For an uptight town like-a this town
 This town, it's a use you town
 An abuse you town until you're down town This town is a losin' town, it's a miserable town
 It's a nowhere town and I am leavin' this town
 You better believe that I'm leavin' this town
 Man, it could never be uptown, it's bound to be downtown This town, bye-bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye-bye
