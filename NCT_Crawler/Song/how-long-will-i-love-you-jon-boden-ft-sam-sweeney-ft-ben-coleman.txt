                        Bài hát: How Long Will I Love You - Jon Boden, Sam Sweeney, Ben Coleman

How long will I love you 
As long as there are stars above you 
And longer if I can 

How long will I need you 
As long as the seasons need to 
Follow their plan 

How long will I be with you 
AS long as the sea is bound to 
Wash upon the sand 

How long will I want you 
As long as you want me to 
And longer by far 

How long will I hold you 
As long as your father told you 
As long as you are 

How long will I give to you 
As long as I live through you 
However long you say 

How long will I love you 
As long as stars are above you 
And longer if I may
                        
                    |
