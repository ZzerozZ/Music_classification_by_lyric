                        Bài hát: Black Smoke - Ann Sophie

When you look at me, you know you’re hard to read
Because the face I see is not the one I know
And when you call me baby, what’s that supposed to mean?
I don’t know who you are, how long can we pretend?

See the change I know
We both don’t have the heart to say
Can’t return to what we were
It will never be the same

‘Cause you said you’d never let me go
And I said I can’t but now we know
That it’s too hard to say three words
Too hard to make it work

When there’s nothing left to talk about
‘Cause you know the flame is running out
Two hearts are left to burn, do you know
We’re only left with smoke

Black smoke
We’re only left with smoke
Black smoke

I tried to tell myself, that it’s all in my head
But the truth remains, we’re just too far apart
You know we’re fooling ourselves if we hold on
‘Cause we’re fighting for something that we don’t want
Just leave it now and walk away

See the change I know
We both don’t have the heart to say
Can’t return to what we were
It will never be the same

‘Cause you said you’d never let me go
And I said I can’t but now we know
That it’s too hard to say three words
Too hard to make it work

When there’s nothing left to talk about
‘Cause you know the flame is running out
Two hearts are left to burn, do you know
We’re only left with smoke

(Too hard to say three words) Black smoke
(Too hard to make it work) We’re only left with smoke
(Too hard to say three words) Black smoke
(Too hard to make it work)

‘Cause you said you’d never let me go, oh no
Yeah, you said you’d never let me go

‘Cause you said you’d never let me go
And I said I can’t but now we know
That it’s too hard to say three words
Too hard to make it work

When there’s nothing left to talk about
‘Cause you know the flame is running out
Two hearts are left to burn, do you know
We’re only left with smoke

Black smoke
We’re only left with smoke
Black smoke
We’re only left with smoke
