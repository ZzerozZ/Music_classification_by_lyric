                        Same old story is back again
 She's not a lover, she's just a friend
 I'm sick and tired for you to blame on me
 Now you think it's funny
 Now you wanna spend your money on girls
 But you forgot when you were down
 That I was around

 Call my lover, hang up, call again
 What in the world is happening
 Listen in, but don't yell at me
 Isn't it ironic all you wanna do is smoke chronic
 Boy, you forgot when you were down
 Who was around

 [1] - I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
 Waiting for love to walk through the door
 I wish I didn't miss you anymore

 Memories don't live like people do
 I'm sick for ever believing you
 Wish you'd bring back the man I knew
 Was good to me, oh Lord
 Everytime you say you're coming
 Boy, you disappoint me, honey
 How well you forgot when you were down
 And I was around

 [Repeat 1]
 [Repeat 1]

 One of these days, it's gonna happen to you
 Missing a love like I'm missing you, babe yeah yeah
 One of these days, when your dreams come true
 That's the one that's gonna do it to you
 Oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

 [Repeat 1 until fade]
