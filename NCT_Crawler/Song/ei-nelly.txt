                        Uh wait a minute now
 Can you hear me out there
 Lunatics, is y'all ready
 Let me hear ya I'ma sucker for cornrows and manicured toes (hey)
 Fendi capri pants and Parasucos (alright)
 Passadity city with one or two throws
 I'm dropping outta high school
 Straight into the pro's, who knows I know
 That I love it when you make your knees touch your elbows
 And break it down low to the flow, there you go
 Now throw it on me slow
 And every time I bust a rhyme, baby give me some more
 You say you like that, when I hit it from behind
 And I'll be right back yea that's my very next line
 I use it time after time, when I'm speaking my mind
 It's no matter if I'm shooting game to a pigeon and dime
 I ask you who that is, talking that *** about the 'tics
 Somebody probably jealous 'cause they bitch got hit
 But nobody else dropping *** like dis, should we apologize
 *** 'em just leave 'em pissed hey [Chorus: x2]
 Andele andale moma E.I. E.I. uh oh
 What's poppin tonight
 Andele andale moma E.I. E.I. uh oh
 If the head right nelly there every night We can go to the break of dawn, nigga
 Money long, nigga
 Go fast up the skirt to talk to the thong, nigga
 Some say I'm wrong *** it I'm grown, nigga
 If you ain't bout money then best be gone, nigga
 I'm flashy (uh) double takes when you walk past me
 Nasty, don't be scared boo, go ahead and ask me
 I drive fasty, call me Jeff Gordon
 In a black SS wit a navigation
 See the black blazion, something smells amazing
 I gotta chick rolling up half black and Asian
 Another one paging telling me to come over
 Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
 I used the v-12 powers, weight loss powers
 From Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower
 Get a room in trump towers just to hit for 3 hours
 Get the bitch up out the room 'cause she used the word ours [Chorus: x2] They got a smash mouth of a whole ounce, of that sticky
 Watch my hands under a gold spout, feeling icky
 Let go off in a hoes mouth, I ain't picky
 Start fronting when the shows out
 What ya mean, 20 inches when they roll out
 Come and get me, big faces when they fold out
 Is ya wit me? Don't make me pull that 44 out
 I keep it close when I the go out
 Then I slide up in an esclade
 Me and E getting solid like the ice capades
 From heat, frosty, roger the rabbit than bugsy
 You understand me, wrapped crisp like mummys If you compare me to your local grocery
 Then you'll see I got more carrots than aisle d
 More bread than aisle e, you can bag and scan me
 Sure like Al be , you can meet tha 'tics in Maui (hey) [Chorus: x2]
