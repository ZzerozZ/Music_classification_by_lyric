                        Bet he feels like an elephant
 Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
 You know that you're dreaming about being loved by him
 Too bad your chances are slim And it's not like Mr. Shock
 To get shy when I ask who always is on top?
 There must be something deep down in the middle down there
 He's not too easily scared He's got friends but they got the feeling
 Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
 Oh, look, see there he is now coming down the stairs
 (Here he comes) He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (yeah)
 'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
 He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
 Somebody grabbed his collar
 He cried the whole way home
 He won't remember a thing 'til it starts again
 That's how it is 'til the end (yeah)
