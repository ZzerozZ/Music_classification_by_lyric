Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times where I should know
I can fly high, I can go long
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times where I should know
I can fly high, I can go long
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know

Stop crying like you're home and think about the show
We're all playing the same game, laying down alone
We're unknown and wrong, special when I come
Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow
Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold
It's written in our story, it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall
Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?

Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, a time where we should know
I can fly high, I can go long
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know
Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold
It's written in our story, it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall
Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?
