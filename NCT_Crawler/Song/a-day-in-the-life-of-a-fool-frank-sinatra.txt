Blues/Jazz|

                        A day in the life of a fool
 A sad and a long lonely day
 I walk the avenue and hope I'll run into
 The welcome sight of you coming my way I stop just across from your door
 But you're never home any more
 So back to my room and there in the gloom
 I cry tears of goodbye
 (That's the way it will be every day in the life of fool)
                        
                    |
