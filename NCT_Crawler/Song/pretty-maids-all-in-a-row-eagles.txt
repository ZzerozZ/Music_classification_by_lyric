                        Hi there,
 How are 'ya?
 It's been a long time
 Seems like we've come a long way
 My, but we learn so slow
 And heroes, they come
 And they go
 And leave us behind as if
 We're s'pposed to know why
 Why do we give up our hearts to the past?
 And why must we grow up so fast?
 And all you wishing well fools
 With your fortunes
 Someone should send you a rose with
 Love from a friend,
 It's nice to here from you again
 And the storybook comes to a close
 Gone are the ribbons and bows
 Things to remember places to go
 Pretty Maids all in a Row
 Oh, oh oh, oh......
                        
                    |
