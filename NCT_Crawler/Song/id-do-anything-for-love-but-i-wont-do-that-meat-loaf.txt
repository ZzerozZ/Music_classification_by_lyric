                        And I would do anything for love, I'd run right into hell and back
 I would do anything for love, I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
 But I'll never forget the way you feel right now, oh no, no way
 And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, I won't do that Anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
 I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, oh I won't do that Some days it don't come easy, and some days it don't come hard
 Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
 Some nights you're breathing fire, and some nights you're carved in ice
 Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
 I know you can save me, no one else can save me now but you
 As long as the planets are turning, as long as the stars are burning
 As long as your dreams are coming true, you better believe it That I would do anything for love, and I'll be there 'til the final act
 I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way tonight
 And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
 Oh I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no I won't do that I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
 But I just won't do that
 I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
 But I just won't do that
 I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
 But I just won't do that Some days I pray for silence, and some days I pray for soul
 Some days I just pray to the God of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
 Some nights I lose the feeling, and some nights I lose control
 Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance
 And the thunder rolls Maybe I'm lonely and that's all I'm qualified to be
 There's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep
 As long as the wheels are turning, as long as the fires are burning
 As long as your prayers are coming true, you better believe it That I would do anything for love, and you know it's true and that's a fact
 I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back But I'll never do it better than I do it with you, so long, so long
 And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
 I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no no no I won't do that I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
 But I just won't do that
 I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
 But I just won't do that I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
 But I just won't do that
 I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
 But I just won't do that I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
 But I just won't do that
 I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
 But I just won't do that I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
 But I just won't do that But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life, no way
 And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
 I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no I won't do that Will you raise me up, will you help me down?
 Will you get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
 Will you make it all a little less cold?
 I can do that, I can do that Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
 Can you colorize my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
 Can you make it all a little less old?
 I can do that, oh oh, now I can do that Will you make me some magic, with your own two hands?
 Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
 Can you give me something I can take home?
 I can do that, oh oh now, I can do that Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
 Will ya hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
 Will you take me places I've never known?
 I can do that, oh oh now, I can do that After a while you'll forget everything
 It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
 And you'll see that it's time to move on
 I won't do that, no I won't do that I know the territory, I've been around
 It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
 And sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
 I won't do that, no I won't do that Anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
 I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no I won't do that
