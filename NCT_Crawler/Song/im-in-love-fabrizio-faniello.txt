                        No matter what they say now I’m in love, 
I do it my own way cause I’m in love, 
And I can't keep that song out of my mind, 
whistling that silly tune all the time. 

(whistle) ... I'm in love 

No matter what they say, I don’t care, 
I whistle any way everywhere, 
I wrote this little song on my own, 
She said that I’m a genius; I’m in love, 

My friends say that I’m crazy, I’m just fine, 
My neighbours stair at me, never mind, 
Cause every time this sweetness of her smile, 
My supersonic girl, I’m in love. 

No matter what they say now I’m in love,
