                        Bài hát: Blast Off - David Guetta, Kaz James

This is the blast off 
It's time to blow this up 
So best you run for cover 
We about to hit self destruct 
Go all my people with me 
And none of us give a *** 
So put them hands up higher 
Let's smash this party up 

This is the blast off 
It's time to blow this up 
So best you run for cover 
We about to hit self destruct 
Go all my people with me 
And none of us give a *** 
So put them hands up higher 
Let's smash this party up 

So put them hands up higher
