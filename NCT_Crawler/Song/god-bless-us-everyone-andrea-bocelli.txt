                        Come together one and all
 In the giving spirit
 Gifts abound here great and small
 Joyously we feel it Blessings sent us from above
 Guide us on our way
 We raise our voice as we rejoice
 Bow our head and pray A miracle has just begun
 God bless us everyone To the voices no one hears
 We have come to find you
 With your laughter and your tears
 Goodness, hope and virtue Father, mother, daughter, son
 Each a treasure be
 One candle's light dispels the night
 Now our eyes can see Burning brighter than the sun
 God bless us everyone
 A miracle has just begun
 God bless us everyone Come together one and all
 In the giving spirit
 Gifts abound here great and small
 Joyously we feel it Father, mother, daughter, son
 Each a treasure be
 One candle's light dispels the night
 Now our eyes can see Burning brighter than the sun
 God bless us everyone
 A miracle has just begun
 God bless us everyone
