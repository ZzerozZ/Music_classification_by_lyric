                        Saturday night and the moon is out
 I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
 Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
 When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet Out in the middle of a big dance floor
 When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
 Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight Well I never have wandered down to New Orleans
 Never have drifted down a bayou stream
 But I heard that music on the radio
 And I swore some day I was gonna go Down Highway 10 past Lafayette
 To Baton Rouge and I won't forget
 To send you a card with my regrets
 'Cause I'm never gonna come back home Saturday night and the moon is out
 I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
 Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
 When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet Out in the middle of a big dance floor
 When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
 Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight They got a alligator stew and a crayfish pie
 A Gulf storm blowin' into town tonight
 Livin' on the delta's quite a show
 They got hurricane parties every time it blows But here up north it's a cold cold rain
 And there ain't no cure for my blues today
 Except when the paper says, "Beausoleil is coming into town"
 Baby let's go down Saturday night and the moon is out
 I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
 Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
 When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet Out in the middle of a big dance floor
 When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
 Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring your sister too
 They got lots of music and lots of room
 When they play you a waltz from 1910
 You gonna feel a little bit young again Well you learned to dance with your rock and roll
 You learned to swing with a do-si-do
 But you learn to love at the fais-so-do
 When you hear a little Jolie Blon Saturday night and the moon is out
 I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
 Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
 When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet Out in the middle of a big dance floor
 When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
 Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight
