                        [AJ:] 
I’ve seen it all a thousand times 
Falling down I'm still alive, Am I? Am I? 
So hard to breathe when the water’s high 
No need to swim I'll learn to fly, so high, so high 
You find the truth in a child’s eyes 
When the only limit is the sky 
Living proof I see myself in you 

[Chorus:] 
When the wall starts to close in 
Your heart is frozen over 
Just show ‘em what you’re made of 
When sun light is fading 
The world will be waiting for you 
Just show ‘em what you’re made of 

[Kevin:] 
Gloves are off, Ready to fight 
Like a lion I will survive. 
Will I? Will I? 
You gotta stand for something 
Even if you stand alone, don’t be afraid 
It’s gonna be alright 

[Nick:] 
You find the truth in a child’s eyes 
When the only limit is the sky (Woo, woo, woo) 
Living proof I see myself in you, (Oh) 

[Chorus:] 
When the wall starts to close in 
Your heart is frozen over 
Just show ‘em what you’re made of 
When sun light is fading 
The world will be waiting for you 
Just show ‘em what you’re made of 
(Just show ‘em what you’re made of) 

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, 
(Just show ‘em what you’re made of) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
(Just show ‘em what you’re made of) 

[Howie:] 
You find the truth in a child’s eyes 
When the only limit is the sky 
Living proof I see myself in you... 

[Chorus:] 
When the wall starts to close in 
Your heart is frozen over 
Just show ‘em what you’re made of 
(You can show 'em what you're made of!) 
When sun light is fading 
The world will be waiting for you 
(For you, for you! ) 
Just show ‘em what you’re made of 
(You can show ‘em what you’re made of) 

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, 
(Just show ‘em what you’re made of) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Just show ‘em what you’re made of...
