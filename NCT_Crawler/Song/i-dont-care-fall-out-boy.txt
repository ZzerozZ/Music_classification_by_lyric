                        Say my name, and his in the same breath, I 
Dare you to say they taste the same, 
Let the leaves fall off in the summer 
And let December glow in flames 

Brace myself and let go, 
Start it over again in Mexico 
These friends, they don't love you 
They just love the hotel suites, now 

I don't care what you think, 
As long as it's about me 
The best of us can find happiness 
In misery 

I don't care what you think 
As long as it's about me 
The best of us can find happiness 
In misery 

Oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance, 
I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants 
Pull a breath like another cigarette, 
Pawn shop heart trading up, said no 

I'm the oracle in my chest, 
Let the guitar scream like a fascist, 
Sweat it out, shut your mouth, 
Free love on the streets, but 

In the alley and I ain't that cheap, now 

I don't care what you think, 
As long as it's about me 
The best of us can find happiness 
In misery 

I don't care what you think, 
As long as it's about me 
The best of us can find happiness 
In misery 


Said-a, I don't care just a-what you think, 
As long as it's about me, you said-a 
I don't care just what you think, 
As long as it's about me, you said-a 
I don't care (I don't care) 
You said I don't care (I don't care) 
Said I don't care, 
I don't care 
I don't care (I don't care), I said-a 
I don't care 

I don't care what you think, 
As long as it's about me 
The best of us can find happiness 
In misery 

I don't care what you think, 
As long as it's about me 
The best of us can find happiness 
In misery..
