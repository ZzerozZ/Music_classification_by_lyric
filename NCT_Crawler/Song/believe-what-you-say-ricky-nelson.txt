                        I believe what you say, when you say
 You're goin' steady with nobody else but me
 I believe what you say, when you say
 You don't kiss nobody else but me

 I believe, do believe, I believe
 Yeah, I believe, pretty baby, believe
 You're goin' steady with nobody else but me

 Well, there's one thing, baby, that I want you to know
 When you're rockin' with me don't rock too slow
 Move on in, get toe-to-toe
 We're gonna rock till we can't rock no more

 I believe, do believe, I believe
 Yeah, I believe, pretty baby, believe
 You're goin' steady with nobody else but me

 Well, let's dig it now

 Well, I believe what you say, when you say
 You don't miss nobody else but me
 I believe what you say, when you say
 You don't kiss nobody else but me

 I believe, do believe, I believe
 Yeah, I believe, pretty baby, believe
 You're goin' steady with nobody else but me

 Well, when you kiss me, baby, then you roll your eyes
 I get a funny feelin' that I'm hypnotized
 Chills run all up and down my spine
 I'm tellin' everybody that you're mine, all mine

 I believe, do believe, I believe
 Oh, I believe, pretty baby, believe
 You're goin' steady with nobody else but me

 Oh, yeah

 Well, I believe, do believe, yeah believe
 Well, believe, pretty baby, believe
 You're goin' steady with nobody else but me
