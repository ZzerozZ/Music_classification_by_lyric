                        You didn't see me walkin' in
 You were lookin' in the mirror and
 You looked perfect
 Hadn't put on your makeup yet
 You were sayin', how your hair's a mess
 But you looked perfect Chorus:
 No, you don't see what I see when I look at you girl
 You don't know how beautiful you are
 You're never ready and you need more time
 You say your jeans never fit you right
 But your eyes and your shy little smile and your own kinda style
 It's so perfect, perfect I hear you singin' to the radio
 Sometimes you miss a couple high notes
 But it sounds perfect
 And when we go out and
 Everywhere's too crowded
 And we just end up drivin' around
 It's, oh baby, it's still perfect
 Just perfect Repeat Chorus Your touch and your kiss and your skin and your lips
 And your name
 All the little imperfections you wish you could change
 Every little everything is perfect Repeat Chorus
                        
                    |
