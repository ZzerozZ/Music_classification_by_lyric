Rock|

                        You're just a waste of time
 You're just a babbling face
 You're just three sick holes that run like sores
 You're a *** waste You're like a slug on the floor
 Oh! You're useless and ugly
 And useless and ugly
 And I shiver and shake
 When I think of how you make me hate I want to smash you to pieces
 I want to smash you up and screaming
 I want to smash you helpless
 Down on the floor
 Smash you until you're not here anymore And I shiver and shake
 I shiver and shake
 Shiver and shake
 Shiver and shake
 Shiver and shake
                        
                    |
