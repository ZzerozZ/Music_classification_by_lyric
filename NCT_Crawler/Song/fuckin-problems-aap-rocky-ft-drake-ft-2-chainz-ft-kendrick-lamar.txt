                        [Hook: 2 Chainz, Drake, and Rocky]
I love bad bitches that's my ***in problem
And yeah I like to *** I got a ***in problem
I love bad bitches that's my ***in problem
And yeah I like to *** I got a ***in problem
I love bad bitches that's my ***in problem
And yeah I like to *** I got a ***in problem
If findin somebody real is your ***in problem
Bring ya girls to the crib maybe we can solve it

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Hold up bitches simmer down
Takin' hella long bitch give it to me now
Make that thing pop like a semi or a nine
Oh baby like it raw with a shimmy shimmy ya
Huh, ASAP get like me
Never met a mother ***er fresh like me
All these mother***ers wanna dress like me
Put the chrome to your dome make you sweat like Keith
Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga
Like how you figure?
Getting figures and ***in bitches
She rollin swishers for her bitches
I bought my niggas they getting bent up off the liquor
She love my licorice, I let her lick it
They say money make a nigga act ***-ish
But at least a nigga nigga rich
I be ***in broads like I be ***in bored
Turn a dyke bitch out have her ***in boys

[Verse 2: Drake]
I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leading on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feeding on
Got a feeling that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
You ain't heard my album? who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a ***ing read-along
Ain't a ***ing sing-along unless you brought the weed along
Then Juuuuuuuuu (laughs) Then Juuuust drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put The Beatles on
All that *** you talkin' bout is not up for discussion
I won't pay to make it bigger I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know then I don't trust it
If you comin' from out here then muhh***a get to bustin'
Yes Looooooooooooorrd I don't really say this often
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talkin
I beast

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah ho this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she's from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vacate in Atlanta, then she going back to Cali
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony I *** 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
Aka Benz is to me is just a car
That mean your friends need to be up to par
See my standards are papered by threesomes tomorrow
Kill em all dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved listen to what the crystal ball say
Halle berry, hallelujah
Holla back i'll do ya
