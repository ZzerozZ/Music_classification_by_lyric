                        I talk to you but its not the same as touchin' you
 And every time you whisper my name, I wanna run to you
 We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
 But it feels like forever, and its hard to be strong Baby 'cause I'm missing you now and its drivin' me crazy
 How I'm needin' you baby, I'm missing you now
 Can't wait till I'm alone with you
 Show you how I'm missing you now Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do
 My arms around my pillow at night, they should be holdin' you
 Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I know
 I can't take this much longer, so hard on my soul Baby 'cause I'm missing you now and its drivin' me crazy
 I got to be with you baby, I'm missing you now
 I don't know what I'm gonna do
 That's the way I'm missing you now Baby I just can't wait, till I see your face
 Chase away this loneliness inside
 When you're close to my heart, right here in my arms
 Then and only then, will I be satisfied, missing you now I know we'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
 But it feels like forever, and its hard to be strong Baby 'cause I'm missing you now and its drivin' me crazy
 I'm needin' you baby, missing you now
 Can't wait till I'm alone with you
 Show you how I'm missing you Missing you, missing you
 Baby I should be holding you, caressing you
 I just missing you now
 I don't know what I'm gonna do
 That's the way I'm missing you Missing you, missing you now
 It's drivin' me crazy
 Oh I'm feeling you baby, I'm just missing you
