She's sticking needles in her skin
I turn with an ugly grin
Her canvas doesn't leave a lot, to fantasy
But her peace of mind, can't stay inside the lines
It's so, confusing, the methods that she's using
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark, that I can see
Will she ever find one million of a kind?
It's cold and lonely but that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world
No one hurts this pretty girl but her...

Oh, she's beautiful
A little better than a man deserves
You are not insane
Please tell me she won't change

[Chorus:]
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (she loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (she loves me)

She's drowning in herself again
My god what a lovely sin
I guess there's nothing left to do, but have my way
She can feel it's right, so she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers, it doesn't seem to matter
Lost inside my dirty head
Something tells me I'm the one who's kept

Oh, so volatile
A little better than a man defiled
Oh I need the pain
Please tell me she won't change

[Chorus]

We were meant to be together
Now die and *** love me
We were meant to hurt each other
Now die and *** love me
Die and *** love me
Die and *** love me
Die and *** love me
                        
                    |
