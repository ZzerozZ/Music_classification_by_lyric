                        You call me up, in tears again
 I come over
 Your only friend
 Put my arms around you
 To stop this lonely night
 You ask me to stay
 I don't think it's right

 When you tell me you're in love with him
 Don't you know that really caves me in
 And I'm not that strong

 [Chorus:]
 Someone should tell you
 How much I love you
 Cos I really do
 Wish I could hold you
 The way that I want to
 Cos no one, can love you, like I do

 You're everything, that I ever dreamed
 You're the only one
 The only one for me
 So we talk all night
 But in my head
 Three little words, that I never said

 You say you don't know what you'd do without me
 Don't you know that this is killing me
 And I'm not that strong

 [Chorus:]

 When you tell me you're in love with him
 Don't you know that really caves me in
 And I'm not that strong
 No I'm not that strong

 [Chorus x2]
                        
                    |
