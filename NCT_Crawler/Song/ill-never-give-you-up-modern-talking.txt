My promise last forever 
I'll never give you up

Oh baby I know, that I'm hurting you so 
But I can't stand the pain, oh I can't let you go 
What are you doing the rest of your life 
Without your love, I can't survive 

I said to myself - I can't let you go 
We're gonna make it 
Baby I know

I need your love, you'll driving me mad 
whatever will be, oh my baby will be 
I miss you like crazy, you're my destiny 
I'll never was so wrong, please don't say goodbye

It's higher than heaven, this love is no lie 
Oh I promise you, this love has no goodbye 
If you love him girl, I will sleep aside 
All the time and motion, oh baby you can't hide 
I'll never was so wrong, please don't say goodbye 
we're gonna make it, gimme one more try
                        
                    |
