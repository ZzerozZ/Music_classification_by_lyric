                        Bài hát: They Can't Take That Away From Me - Jose James

There are many, many crazy things that will keep me lovin' you
And with your permission, may I list a few?

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No no, they can't take that away from me

The way youre smile just beams
The way you sing off-key
The way you haunt my dreams
No no they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again on the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of
The way you hold your knife
The way we dance 'til three
The way you've changed my life
No no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me
                        
                    |
