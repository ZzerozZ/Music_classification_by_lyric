                        Bài hát: Shake It Off - Ryan Adams

I stay out too late, got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, that's what people say
I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay
Least that's what people say, that's what people say
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind sayin' it's gonna be alright

[Chorus:]
Cause the players gonna play
And the haters gonna hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
And the fakers gonna fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off

I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
That's what they don’t see, that's what they don’t see
I'm dancing on my own, I'll make up the moves as I go
And that's what they don't know, that’s what they don’t know

[Chorus:]
Cause the players gonna play
And the haters gonna hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
And the fakers gonna fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake

Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off, shake it off
