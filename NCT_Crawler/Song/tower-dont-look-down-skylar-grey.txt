                        Bài hát: Tower (Don'T Look Down) - Skylar Grey

You're high upon the tower
Now don't look down
I will be okay here on the ground
And you can always call
To say hello from time to time
When you're no longer mine

[Verse 1]
I will be drunk on cheap beer
Like everyone else around here
You've got the world at your feet
There's nothing out there for me.

[Pre-Hook]
You don't have to lie
Saying that you'll try
To make it work from a distance
Just leave me here to die
As I watch you climb
Up to the top of your ambitions

[Hook]
Yo u're high upon the tower
Now don't look down
I will be okay here on the ground
And you can always call
To say hello from time to time
When you're no longer mine

[Verse 2]
Here in a pale shaded light
Under the trailer park lights
There'll be nothing left for you to see
You won't even recognize me

[Pre-Hook]
You don't have to lie
Saying that you'll try
To make it work from a distance
Just leave me here to die
As I watch you climb
Up to the top of your ambitions

[Hook]
Yo u're high upon the tower
Now don't look down
I will be okay here on the ground
And you can always call
To say hello from time to time
When you're no longer mine

[Bridge]
I always knew that you would follow your big dreams
What I didn't know is that your dreams
Never did include me

[Hook]
You're high upon the tower
Now don't look down
I will be okay here on the ground
And you can always call
To say hello from time to time
When you're no longer mine
                        
                    |
