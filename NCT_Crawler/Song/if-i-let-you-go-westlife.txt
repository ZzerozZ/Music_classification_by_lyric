                        Bài hát: If I Let You Go - Westlife

Day after day
Time passed away 
And I just can't get you out of my mind 
Nobody knows, I hide it inside 
I keep on searching but I just can't find 
The courage to show to let you know
I've never felt love like this before 
And once again I'm thinking about 
Taking the easy way out 
[CHORUS]
But if I let you go I will never know 
What my life would be holding you close to me 
Will I ever see you smiling back at me ? (oh yeah) 
How will I know if I let you go ? 

Night after night I hear myself say 
Why don't this feeling just fade away 
There's no one like you (no one like you) 
You speak to my heart (speak to my heart) 
It's such a a shame we're worlds apart 
I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to lose 
But sooner or later I gotta choose 
And once again I'm thinking about 
Taking the easy way out 

[CHORUS]
If I let you go I will never know 
What my life would be, holding you close to me 
Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (oh yeah) 
How will I know if I let you go ? 

If I let you go ooooh baby 
Ooooooooohhhhh 
Once again I'm thinking about 
Taking the easy way out
                        
                    |
