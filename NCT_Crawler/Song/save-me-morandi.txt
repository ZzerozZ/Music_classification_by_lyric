                        Bài hát: Save Me - Morandi

When I'm with you
Everything seems better
Now I know
I see it all today
We were ment to be together
I'm in pain when you're away

Come on and save me
I'm loosing my touch
Day after day
Cause I miss you so much
Come on and save me
I'm loosing my mind
Waiting and waiting
For you to be mine

Come and save me
From me... me...
Come and save me
From me... me...

When I'm with you
Everything seems better
Now I know
I see it all today
We were ment to be together
I'm in pain when you're away

Come on and save me
I'm loosing my touch
Day after day
Cause I miss you so much
Come on and save me
I'm loosing my mind
Waiting and waiting
For you to be mine

Come and save me
From me... me...
Come and save me
From me... me...
