                        The God That Failed
Artist: Metallica

Pride you took
pride you feel
pride that you felt when you'd kneel
not the word
not the love
not what you thought from above
it feeds
it grows
it clouds all that you will know
deceit
deceive
decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
never your hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
broken is the promise, betrayal
the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
follow the god that failed
find your peace
find your say
find the smooth road in your way
trust you gave
a child to save
left you cold and him in grave
it feeds
it grows
it clouds all that you will know
deceit
deceive
decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
broken is the promise, betrayal
the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
follow the god that failed
I see faith in your eyes
broken is the promise, betrayal
the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
follow the god that failed
pride you took
pride you feel
pride that you felt when you'd kneel
trust you gave
a child to save
left you cold and him in grave
I see faith in your eyes
never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
broken is the promise, betrayal
the healing hand held back by deepened nail
follow the god that failed
