                        Sweat - Inner Circle

 I've been watching you

 C'mon!

 Hey!

 Standing across the room
 I saw you smile
 Said I want to talk to you-oo-oo
 For a little while
 But before I make my move
 My emotions start running wild
 My tongue gets tied
 And that's no lie

 Looking in your eyes
 Looking in you big brown eyes
 Ooh yeah
 And I've got this to say to you
 Hey!

 Girl I want to make you sweat
 Sweat till you can't sweat no more
 And if you cry out
 I'm gonna push it some, mo-o-ore
 Girl I want to make you sweat
 Sweat till you can't sweat no more
 And if you cry out
 I'm gonna push it
 Push it, push it some more


 C'mon!

 Ooh

 So I said to myself
 "Does she love me or not?"

 But the dreads done know
 That love is his to get
 With a little bit of this
 And a little bit of that
 the lyrics goes on the attack
 My tongue gets tied
 And that's no lie

 Looking in your eyes
 Looking in your big brown eyes
 Ooh girl
 And I've got this to say to you
 Hey!

 Girl I want to make you sweat
 Sweat till you can't sweat no more
 And if you cry out
 I'm gonna push it some mo-o-ore
 Girl I want to make you sweat
 Sweat till you can't sweat no more
 And if you cry out
 I'm gonna push it
 Push it, push it some more


 Ooh yeah!

 One more time!

 Sing it!

 Hey!

 Woo woo woo woo wee yeah

 I'm looking in your big brown eyes
 Ooh Yeah
 And I've got this to say to you
 Hey!

 Girl I want to make you sweat
 Sweat till you can't sweat no more
 And if you cry out
 I'm gonna push it some mo-o-ore
 Girl I want to make you sweat
 Sweat till you can't sweat no more
 And if you cry out
 I'm gonna push it
 Push it, push it some more


 Yeah!

 Push it, push it some more

 Alright!

 Push it, push it some more
