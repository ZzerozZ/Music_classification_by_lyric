                        Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Wait a minute

 I'm not dreamgirl, not perfection
 Never said I was from heaven
 But baby I could be the closest that you met
 (Y'all aint ready, it's Nicole!)
 I was looking for that someone that don't exist and
 And he want some
 What you want isn't always what you get
 (Let's go)

 You want your girl to give advice
 But you're always, always right
 You want her naughtier than nice
 And you don't ever wanna fight
 You want her hanging out at home
 Even when she's all alone
 You want everything but that's a dream
 So tell me

 Who's gonna love you baby
 Who's gonna be there for you
 Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do
 Who's gonna hold you down
 Pick you up off the ground
 Who's gonna make your day the way that I do

 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Wait a minute

 The grass is always greener
 From where you're standing something's sweeter
 You never know just what got until it's gone
 But I'm the real thing and that's a good thing
 Coz what I bring is really something
 I'm a girl who will never be what she's not

 You want your girl to give advice
 But you're always, always right
 You want her naughtier than nice
 And you don't ever wanna fight
 You want her hanging out at home
 Even when she's alone
 You want everything but that's a dream
 So tell me

 Who's gonna love you baby
 Who's gonna be there for you
 Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do
 Who's gonna hold you down
 Pick you up off the ground
 Who's gonna make your day the way that I do

 No one loves you like I love you
 No one in the world
 (Let's go)
 No one loves you, like I love you
 No one in the world

 You want your girl to give advice
 But you're always, always right
 You want her naughtier than nice
 And you don't ever wanna fight
 You want her hanging out at home
 Even when she's alone
 You want everything but that's a dream
 Tell me, tell me

 Who's gonna love you baby
 Who's gonna be there for you
 Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do
 Who's gonna hold you down
 Pick you up off the ground
 Who's gonna make your day the way that I do

 Who's gonna love you baby
 Who's gonna be there for you
 Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do
 Who's gonna hold you down
 Pick you up off the ground
 Who's gonna make your day the way that I do

 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody
 Nobody, Nobody

 Who's gonna love you baby
 Who's gonna be there for you
 Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do
 Who's gonna hold you down
 Pick you up off the ground
 Who's gonna make your day the way that I do
