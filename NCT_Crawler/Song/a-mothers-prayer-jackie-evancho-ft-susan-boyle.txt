                        I pray you'll be our eyes
 And watch us where we go
 And help us to be wise
 In times when we don't know Let this be our prayer
 When we lose our way
 Lead us to a place
 Guide us with your grace
 To a place where we'll be safe I pray we'll find your light
 And holds it in our hearts
 When stars go out each night
 Remind us where you are Let this be our prayer
 When shadows fill our day
 Lead us to a place
 Guide us with your grace
 Give us faith so we'll be safe A world where pain and sorrow will be ended
 And every heart that's broken will be mended
 And we'll remember we are all gods children
 Reaching out to touch you
 Reaching to the stars We ask that life be Kind
 And watch us from above
 We hope each soul will find
 Another soul to love Let this be your prayer
 Just like every child
 Who needs to find a place
 Guide us with your grace
 Give us faith so we'll be safe Needs to find a place
 Guide us with your grace
 Give us faith so we'll be safe
