                        Hopes dashed to the floor
 Like shattered teenage dreams
 Boys livin' next door
 Are never what they seem A walk in the park can become a bad dream
 People are starin' and followin' me
 This is my only escape from it all
 Watchin' a film or a face on the wall Robert De Niro's waiting
 Talking Italian
 Robert De Niro's waiting
 Talking Italian
 Robert De Niro's waiting
 Talking Italian
 Robert De Niro's waiting I don't need a boy
 I've got a man of steel
 Don't come any closer
 I don't wanna feel You're breathing, you're touching, but nothing's for free
 I never want this to happen to me
 Don't try to change me you're wasting your time
 Now I've got somethin' much better in mind Robert De Niro's waiting
 Talking Italian
 Robert De Niro's waiting
 Talking Italian
 Robert De Niro's waiting
 Talking Italian
 Robert De Niro's waiting Talk talkin'
 Talk talkin' A walk in the park can become a bad dream
 People are starin' and followin' me
 This is my only escape from it all
 Watchin' a film or a face on the wall Robert De Niro's waiting
 Talking Italian
 Robert De Niro's waiting
 Talking Italian
 Robert De Niro's waiting
 Talking Italian
 Robert De Niro's waiting
