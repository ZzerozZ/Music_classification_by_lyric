                        Love is here
 And, oh my darling, now you're gone
 Love is here
 And, oh my darling, now you're gone
 You persuaded me to love you
 And I did
 But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead
 Into your arms I fell
 So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there
 You closed the door of your heart and turned the key
 Locked your love away from me Love is here
 And, oh my darling, now you're gone
 You made me love you
 And oh my darling, now you're gone
 You said loving you would make life beautiful
 With each passing day
 But as soon as love came into my heart
 You turned and you walked just one way
 You stripped me of my dreams
 You gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now Look at me
 See what loving you has done to me
 Look at my face
 See how crying has left its trace
 After you made me all your own
 And you left me all alone
 You made your words sound so sweet
 Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
 My heart cries out for your touch
 But you're not there
 And the lonely cry fades in the air Love is here
 And, oh my darling, now you're gone
 Love is here
 And, oh my darling, now you're gone
 You made me love you
 Oh my darling, now you're gone
 You made me love you
 Oh my darling, now you're gone
                        
                    |
