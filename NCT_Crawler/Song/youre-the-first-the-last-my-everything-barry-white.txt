                        Bài hát: You're The First, The Last, My Everything - Barry White

My first, my last, my everything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
You're all I'm living for, your love I'll keep forevermore
First, you're the last, my everything

In you I've found so many things
A love so new, only you could bring
Can't you see it's you? You make me feel this way
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day

I see so many ways that I can love you 'til the day I die
You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, the last, my everything

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl, you're my reality, but I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, you're the last, my everything
                        
                    |
