                        Bài hát: More Than You - Class Actress

[Verse 1]
Come over here, beautiful reaction
Come over here, beautiful distraction
I never wanted anything more than I want you
I never wanted anything more than I want you

[Chorus]
You got me over thinking
New York City drinking
Never wanted nothing like I want you
My mind is breaking
What if I just say it
Never wanted more than I want
Nothing, nothing more than you

[Post-Chorus]
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
More than you
Not enough hours in the night
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Verse 2]
Come over here, I never had a choice in us
So whatcha fear? Cause there's a little poison in all of us
Never wanted anything more than I want you
Never wanted anything more than I want you

[Chorus]
You got me over thinking
New York City drinking
Never wanted nothing like I want you
My mind is breaking
What if I just say it
Never wanted more than I want
Nothing, nothing more than you

[Bridge]
More than you
Nothing, nothing more than you
More than you
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
No, there's nothing, nothing, nothing
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
No, there's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Chorus] + [Post-Chorus] (x4)
                        
                    |
