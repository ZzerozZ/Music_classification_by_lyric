                        Bài hát: Rock And Roll Days - Lobo

Since I was a boy back in the rock and roll days
Back when a bust was a six-pack of cold beer.
Marciano, he was champ the band all played through one amp
And the biggest thing was getting rubber in second gear
I love the rock and roll days
And I love all the good old ways
We used to do things in our crowd
I love the rock and roll days
And I love all the good old ways
We used to do the same things that we do now.
The only bikes back there were Schwinns
The only pigs were the bad wolf's friend
And going to the outdoor movie was something neat
Messing around then was not big
That's the one thing I did not dig
I was lucky to get as far as the back seat.
