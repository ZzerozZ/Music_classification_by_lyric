Âu Mỹ khác|

                        I was walking down the street one day
Then I saw you I didn't know what to say
Your eyes were shining
Your smile was so kind
When I saw you I wanted you to be mine

Maybe I don't have the blond hair you like
Or maybe I don't have eyes like the sky
And I'm not sure if I'm the girl in your dreams
But I can show you what love means

One day you came and talked to me
And you said we are meant to be
I was happy, everything was so nice
But then I found out that everything was a lie

Maybe I don't have the blond hair you like
Or maybe I don't have eyes like the sky
And I'm not sure if I'm the girl in your dreams
But I can show you what love means

How could you do this to me
You said we are meant to be
You showed me how to cry
When you told me that everything was a lie

Maybe I don't have the blond hair you like
Or maybe I don't have eyes like the sky
And I'm not sure if I'm the girl in your dreams
But I can show you what love means
                        
                    |
