                        (B. Andersson, B. Ulvus)
 We take so much for granted, he and I
 We share a life in one dimension
 Our problems always seem to cloud the sky
 But we don't pay them much attention
 And with every day
 We drift apart
 I can feel it in my heart
 That man is not the man I used to know
 And though a part of me still needs him so
 there's something wrong
 And I feel my love die
 Slowly, slowly
 No angry words and no heart-rending scenes
 And we should take it as a warning
 We keep on going through the old routines
 Exchanging kisses in the morning
 And with every day we drift apart
 And the fear is in my heart
 I read the signs and I should be mature
 And yet a child could not be more unsure
 there's something wrong
 And I feel my love die
 Slowly, slowly
 Our passion's just a distant memory
 And in its place a dull frustration
 A cold indifference where there used to be
 At least a frequent irritation
 But a feeling still
 Of tenderness
 And of pity, so I guess
 I'll be the woman in his arms tonight
 If he should need someone to hold him tight
 He's like a child
 But I feel my love die
 Slowly
 That man is not the man I used to know
 And though a part of me still needs him so
 there's something wrong
 And I feel my love die
 Slowly, slowly
 Slowly, slowly
 Slowly, slowly
 Slowly, slowly
