R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        Yea, turn the music up a little bit
 Yea, a little bit louder, right there
 In the name of the streets Click, click, boo ya, Dub kicked the frame in
 Nigga, let the games begin, as I standin'
 Tossed the tall can on a campus, off the limital
 Scanners takin' penitentiary chances Sick wit it, off the ric wit it
 Blue beenie knitted, freshly acquitted
 Grind, grimey, the big body an' the big body
 Wit lyrics an' 'draulics hotter than the Majave Sellin', brubble bellin', career felon
 Escalade, 3 braid beer wearin'
 *** it, I thug for free an' thug to eat
 Niggas call me 'Home of Cake' 'cause I love the cheese Gangstas, hustlas, pimps, if ya follow me
 Let me see ya put them hands up like a robbery
 I solemnly swear to stay down an' slang the seed
 I spit in the name of the streets I'm gonna roll, I'm gon' stay fly
 I'm gonna bust, hold my hood up high
 In the name of the streets
 I'm gonna roll, I'm gon' rich ride
 I'm gonna ball, hold my hood up high
 In the name of the streets This the itty bitty nigga, from the city they call LB
 What you know about the D O G?
 I keep my peeps wit a bag o' treats
 On the streets, my nephews beat your beat an' keep that heat In the Cutt an' indiscrete
 Me an' Dub-C crippin' cousins in this industry
 A lotta' y'all pretend to be
 Wanna see, friends wit me an' then sleep wit the enemy? Want some, get some, bad enough, take some
 Suckas poppin' off, I'm 'bout to take one
 Braids on, make done, don't want none
 An' just 'cause we talkin', what you doin' C walkin'? It's not just a dance, it's a way o' livin'
 Now if ya C walkin', ya best to see Crippin'
 An' that goes for kids too an' R an' B singers
 Nigga, quit Crip walkin' if ya ain't a gang banger I'm gonna roll, I'm gon' stay fly
 I'm gonna bust, hold my hood up high
 In the name of the streets
 I'm gonna roll, I'm gon' rich ride
 I'm gonna ball, hold my hood up high
 In the name of the streets I told a woman I don't love her but she wants to go
 I told another that I want her but she wants to hoe
 I ain't a hater, I'm a player, so I *** 'em both
 In the name of the streets This is for them geniuz
 Da best is my East niazz, both sides street niazz
 This is for them DJs, coast to coast movin' this
 Spinnin' them turntables that bomp the Ruvian Smashous, best trap us for cash
 An' dump a blunt at ya's, outta the mix classes
 This is for them riders, ridin' for the mims
 Ghetto ass niazz on them big shiny rims Thrashin', you're back at ya, bring a debassa'
 Got droppin' on your drastic, another hood classic
 Dub the 'Ghetto Heisman' singin' 'More cabbage'
 A street niazz livin' on seek an' kill status Unlock the racked, Def Jam cock ya' back
 Recess is over, I want my spot back
 Who's the next? I preceded to blow comin' at 'em
 I'm in a mink coat an' Spacey gat 'em, you're lookin' at 'em I'm gonna roll, I'm gon' stay fly
 I'm gonna bust, hold my hood up high
 In the name of the streets
 I'm gonna roll, I'm gon' rich ride
 I'm gonna ball, hold my hood up high
 In the name of the streets Dub C, The 'Ghetto Heisman'
 In the name of the streets
 Swangin' through a hood near you
 In the name of the streets
