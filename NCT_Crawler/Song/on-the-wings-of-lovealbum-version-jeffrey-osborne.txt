                        Just smile for me and let the day begin
 You are the sunshine that lights my heart within
 I'm sure that you're an angel in disguise
 Come take my hand and together we will rise
 On the wings of love up and above the clouds
 The only way to fly Is on the wings of love
 On the wings of love
 Only the two of us together flying high
 Flying high upon the wings of love
 You look at me and I begin to melt
 Just like the snow when a ray of sun is felt
 I'm crazy bout ya baby can't you see
 I'd be so delighted if you could come with me
 On the wings of love
 Up and above the clouds
 The only way to fly
 Is on the wings of love
 On the wings of love
 Only the two of us
 Together flying high
 Flying high upon the wings of love
 Yes... You belong to me I'm yours exclusively
 Right now we live and breathe each other
 Inseparable it seems, We're flowing like a stream
 Running free flowing
 On the wings of love
 On the wings of love
 Up and above the clouds
 The only way to fly
 Is on the wings of love
 On the wings of love
 Only the two of us
 Together flying high
 Together flying high
 On the wings of love
 Up and above the clouds
 The only way to fly
 Is on the wings of love
 On the wings of love
 Only the two of us
 Together flying high
 Flying high up on the wings of love of love...
