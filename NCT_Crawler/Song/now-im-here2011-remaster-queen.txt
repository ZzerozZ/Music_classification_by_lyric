                        Here I stand (here I stand...)
 Look around around around around
 (Around around around around...)
 But you wont see me (you wont see me...)
 Now I'm here (now I'm here...)
 Now I'm there (now I'm there...)
 I'm just a just a new man
 Yes you made me live again

 A baby I was when you took my hand
 And the light of the night burned bright
 The people all stared didn't understand
 But you knew my name on sight
 Ooh, whatever came of you and me?
 Americas new bride to be
 Don't worry baby I'm safe and sound
 Down in the dungeon just peaches and me
 Don't I love her so?
 Yes she made me live again yeah! Yeah

 A thin moon me in the smoke screen sky
 Where the beams of your love light chase
 Don't move don't speak don't feel no pain
 With the rain running down my face
 Your matches still light up the sky
 And many a tear lives on in my eye
 Down in the city just hoople and me
 Don't I love him so don't I love him so?

 Whatever comes of you and me
 I love to leave my memories with you

 Now I'm here (now I'm here.)
 Think I'll stay around around around
 (Around around around around...)
 Down in the city just you and me
 (Down in the city just you and me...)

 Don't I love you so?

 Go go go little queenie
