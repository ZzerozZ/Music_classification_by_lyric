                        Bài hát: I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor

At first I was afraid I was petrified
Thinking I couldn't live without you by my side
And I've been spending nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And now you're back
From outer space
And I find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
Oh made you leave your key
If I've known for a second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And all my love to give and I'll survive
I, I, I will survive

It took all my strength not to fall apart
Trying' without my mind to mend my broken heart
I spent so many nights
Feeling sorry for myself, how I cried
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that lonely little person who's still in love with you
Now you come dropping in
Expecting me to be free
Now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me
Go on now, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Think I'd might crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got my life to live
And all my love to give and I'll survive
I, I, I will survive

Go and go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And all my love to give and I'll survive
I, I, I will survive

It took all my strength not to fall apart
Trying' without my mind to mend my broken heart
I spent so many nights
Feeling sorry for myself, how I cried
Now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
Not that lonely little person who's still in love with you
Now you come dropping in
Expecting me to be free
but I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me

Go on and go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Think I'd might crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got my life to live
And all my love to give and I'll survive
I, I, I will survive

Go on and go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
