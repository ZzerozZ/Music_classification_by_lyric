                        Bài hát: If You Had My Love - Jennifer Lopez

[CHORUS:]
If you had my love 
And I gave you all my trust 
Would you comfort me 
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue 
Would you lie to me 
And call me baby 
Now if I gave you me, this is how it's got to be 
First of all I won't take you cheatin' on me 
Tell me who can I trust if I can't trust in you 
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool 
You said that we could possibly spend eternity 
See that's what you told me (that's what you said) 
But if you want me 
You have to be fulfilling all my dreams 
(If you really want me babe) 

[CHORUS]

Said you want my love and you've got to have it all 
But first there are some things you need to know 
If you want to live 
With all I have to give 
I need to feel true love 
Or it's got to end, yeah 
I don't want you 
Trying to get with me 
And I end up unhappy 
(Don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain) 
So before I do 
Give myself to you 
I have to know the truth 
(If I spend my life with you)
                        
                    |
