                        Bài hát: Pieces - Tamar Braxton

Don't you say a word to me
 I don't wanna hear it
 You say you miss me
 I don't wanna feel it, I don't wanna feel it
 If you really wanted to be
 Oh, if you really wanted to be here
 You would make a woman out of me
 Oh, I'll be the one you believe in 
You don't want my love I swear you don't want it
 You don't want my trust I swear you don't want it
 Gave you my all for what? I swear you don't want it
 You don't want it bad enough,
I'ma take it back I don't want your pieces
 Oh no no no no
 I don't want your pieces
 Oh no no no no If you can't give me up your love
 I don't want your love
 It's like you threw a curve at me
 Can't you see I'm hurting
 It's gonna be hard for me
 I know this where your heart been
 I'm where your heart went tryna let go of you
 But I don't really know if I can do it
 Close the door on you
 You don't really wanna see me do it, no I tried a thousand times
 Told my heart a thousand lies
 You won't let me say goodbye
 You don't wanna see me do it, no I don't want your pieces
 Oh no no no no
 I don't want your pieces
 Oh no no no no 
If you can't give me up your love
 I don't want your love no no 
If you can't give me up your love
 I don't want your love no, no, no
No baby, it's so clear
 You leave me here
 Wondering, dreaming, still believing
 What you say, boy, I'm not for it baby
 I don't know who you think you're playing
 Boy you know I'm the only one you're needing
 Truth of the matter is you don't think 
I really have the strength to leave
 But I don't want no Pieces
 Oh no no no no
 I don't want your pieces
 I'm tired of giving all of my love
 I don't want your pieces
 Oh no no no no
 I don't want your pieces
 Oh no I deserve more than just a little part
 I don't want nothing, if I can't have it all
 I ain't even gonna play with something I can't keep
 I want the whole thing, or forget about me
