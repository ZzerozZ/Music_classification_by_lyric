                        Sun down, Friday night,
 Uptown city lights,
 Here I go start it out,
 I like,
 Dressed up out the door
 So damn ready for one night maybe more,
 I like, I like,
 With strobe light hot corse dirty minds
 When you cross my way,
 I like, I like,
 Just you and I touch at first sight,

 And the world around us wont stop turning to night,
 I like, I like,
 I'm losing control right now and I feel it's right,
 I like, I like,
 Were caught in this moment I wont let you go,
 And the world around us wont stop turning to night,
 I like, I like, I like, I like,

 Hey there pure star lets go way to far come a little closer
 I like,
 Heart flips up and down,
 Dancing on sleezy ground,
 Betcha want to get it on,
 I like, I like,
 You've got me down right electrified,
 Don't stop the rides,
 I like I like,
 Just you and I,
 Here and now what a night

 I, I, I, and the world around us wont stop turning to night,
 I like, I like,
 I'm losing control right now and I feel it's right,
 I like, I like,
 Were caught in this moment I wont let you go,
 And the world around us wont stop turning to night,
 I like, I like, I like, I like,

 Dance all night don't stop the music,
 I like I can't refuse it,
 Dance all night don't stop the music,
 I like I can't refuse it

 And the world around us wont stop turning to night,
 I like, I like,
 I'm losing control right now and I feel it's right,
 I like, I like,
 Were caught in this moment
 I wont let you go
 And the world around us wont stop turning to night,
 I like, I like, I like, I like, I like
