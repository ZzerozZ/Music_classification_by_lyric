                        Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
 There's a land that I dreamed of once in a lullaby
 Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
 And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star
 And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
 Where troubles melt like lemon drops
 High above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
 Bluebirds fly
 Birds fly over the rainbow
 Why then, oh why can't I?
