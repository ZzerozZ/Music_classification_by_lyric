                        Sometimes I get a good feeling
 I get a feeling that I never, never had before
 And I got to tell you right now
 I believe, I really do believe that Something's got a hold on me
 (Oh, it must be love)
 Something's got a hold on me right now child
 (Yeah, it must be love) Let me tell you now
 I got a feeling, I feel so strange
 Everything about me seems to have changed
 Step by step, I got a brand new walk
 I even sound sweeter when I talk
 I said, Oh yeah
 It must be love
 (You know it must be love) Let me tell you now
 Something's got a hold on me
 (Oh, it must be love)
 Something's got a hold on me right now child
 (Yeah, it must be love) Let me tell you now
 I never felt like this before
 Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
 I believe I'd die if I only could
 I sure feel strange, but I sure feel good
 I said, Oh yeah
 It must be love
 (You know it must be love) Let me tell you now
 My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
 I shake all over, but I feel alright
 I never felt like this before
 Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
 I never thought it could happen to me
 My heart was heavy when in misery
 I never thought it could be this way
 Love's sure gonna put a hurting on me I said Oh yeah
 It must be love
 (You know it must be love)
 Yeah he walks like love
 (Yeah he walks like love)
 And he talks like love
 (And he talks like love)
 Makes me feel alright
 (Makes me feel alright)
 In the middle of the night
 (In the middle of the night)
 Na na na na!
