                        Bài hát: It's All Over But The Crying - The Ink Spots

It's all over, but the crying
And nobody's crying but me
Friends all over know I'm trying
To forget about how much I care for you

It's all over, but the dreaming
Poor little dreams that keep trying to come true
It's all over, but the crying
And I can't get over crying over you

It's all over, but the crying
And nobody's crying but me
Friends all over know I'm trying
To forget about how much I care for you

It's all over, but the dreaming
Poor little dreams that keep trying to come true
It's all over, but the crying
And I can't get over crying over you
                        
                    |
