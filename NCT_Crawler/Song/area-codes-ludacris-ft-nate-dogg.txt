                        I've got hoes
 I've got hoes, in different area codes (area, area codes, codes)
 Hoes, hoes, hoes, in different area codes (area, area codes, codes) Now you thought I was just 7-7-0
 And 4-0-4, I'm worldwide bitch, act like y'all don't know
 It's the abominable hoe man
 Globe-trot international post man
 Neighbor-dick dope man
 7-1-8s, 2-0-2's
 I send small cities and states I-O-U's
 9-0-1, matter fact 3-0-5
 I'll jump off the G4, we can meet outside
 So control your ***mones and keep your drawers on
 'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bones
 3-1-2, 3-1-3, 2-1-5, 8-0-3
 Read your horoscope and eat some *** d'oeuvres
 Ten on pump one these hoes is self serve
 7-5-7, 4-1-0, my cell phone says overload I've got hoes
 I've got hoes, in different area codes (area, area codes, codes)
 Hoes, hoes, hoes, in different area codes (area, area codes, codes) Now everyday is a holiday
 So stop the violence and put the 4-4 away, skeet shoot a ho today
 5-0-4, 9-7-2
 7-1-3, what ya goin' do
 You checking up the scene, I'm checking a ho tonight
 With perpendicular vehicular homicide
 3-1-4, 2-0-1
 Too much green, too much fun
 I bang cock in Bangkok
 Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot
 Think not, I'm the thrilla in Manilla,
 Schlong in Hong Kong
 Pimp em like Bishop, magic Don Juan
 Man after Henny with a coke and a smile
 I just pick up the motherfucking phone and dial
 I got my condoms in a big-ass-sack
 I'm slagging this dick like a New Jack, bitch Is it cause they like my gangsta walk?
 Is it cause they like my gangsta talk?
 Is it cause they like my handsome face?
 Is it cause they like my gangsta ways?
 Whatever it is, they love it
 And they just won't let me be
 I handle my biz, don't rush me
 Just relax and let me be free
 Whenever I call, come running
 2-1-2 or 2-1-3
 You know that I ball, stop fronting
 'For I call my substitute freak I've got hoes
 I've got hoes, in different area codes (area, area codes, codes)
 Hoes, hoes, hoes, in different area codes (area, area codes, codes) 9-1-6, 4-1-5, 7-0-4
 Shout out to the 2-0-6
 Everybody in the 8-0-8
 2-1-6, 7-0-2, 4-1-4
 3-1-7, 2-1-4, 2-8-1
 3-3-4, 2-0-5, I see ya
 3-1-8, 6-0-1, 2-0-3
 8-0-4, 4-0-2, 3-0-1
