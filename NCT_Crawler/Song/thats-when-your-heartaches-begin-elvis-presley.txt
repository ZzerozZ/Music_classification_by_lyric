                        If you find your sweetheart in the arms of a friend
 That's when your heartaches begin
 When dreams of a lifetime must come to an end
 That's when your heartaches begin Love is a thing you'd never can share
 When you bring a friend into your love affair
 That's the end of your sweetheart
 That's the end of your friend
 That's when your heartaches begin If you find your sweetheart
 In the arms of your best friend, your brother
 That's, that's when your heartaches begin And you know, when all your dreams
 When all your dreams of a lifetime
 Must, must all come to an end
 Yeah that's, that's when your heartaches begin Oh, you see love is a thing that
 That you never can share
 And you know, when you bring a friend
 Into your love affair That's the end of your sweetheart
 That's the end of your friend
 Well, that's when your heartaches begin
                        
                    |
