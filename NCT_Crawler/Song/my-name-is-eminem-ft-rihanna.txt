 Slim Shady Hi! My name is (what?)
 Excuse me, (my name is) (who? My name is)
 Slim Shady
 Can I get the attention of the class (huh my name is, what my name is)
 For one second My name is (My name is Slim Shady) Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
 Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
 Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
 Try 'cid and get *** up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
 My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
 But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
 And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a base-head!" Uh-uh!
 "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
 Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
 'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
 Got *** and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
 And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
 I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
 Who sat down too fast
 C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
 I don't give a ***, God sent me to piss the world off! Hi! My name is (what?)

 My name is
 Slim Shady My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
 Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
 I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
 Chased him with a stapler
 Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
 Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
 Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
 Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
 While they screamin' at me "Let's just be friends!"
 Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
 I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
 I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
 Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
 You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
 Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
 This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
 So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ***!" Hi! My name is (huh?)
 My name is (who?)

 Slim Shady Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
 Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
 I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (*** that!)
 I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
 (Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'?
 I can barely decide
 I just drank a fifth of vodka,
 Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
 I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
 (Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
 I spit when I talk, I'll *** anything that walks (C'mere)
 When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
 How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
 I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
 Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
 I'm steamin' mad (Argh!) And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
 Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had Hi! My name is (what?)
