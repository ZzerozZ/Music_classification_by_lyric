Love After War... 
Love After War... 
Love After War... Oooh it's a knock-out baby, you want the fight 
I said I'm sorry that I acted like a selfish child 
Please forgive me baby, I was out of line 
You know I can make it right 
Don't you love it when we fight Love After War... 
I need you tonight baby 
Love After War... 
Come on and let me make it right baby 
Love After War... 
I'm knockin on your door 
Love After War... 
You know I want it, you know I want ya Cuddle up, doors, clap, door slams and broken lights 
Bottles hit the TV screen 
You got to go, or I'm gonna leave 
Throwing clothes into the yard 
When we go we go so hard 
It only makes me want you more, more, more Love After War... 
I need you tonight baby 
Love After War... 
Come on and let me make it right baby 
Love After War... 
I'm knockin on your door 
Love After War... 
You know I want it, Don't you leave 
That's all we need...

Thats all we need Love After War... 
I just wanna love you lady 
Love After War... 
Wanna put down our weapons baby 
Love After War... 
Lay your clothes down on the floor 
Love After War... 
And give me some love after war Love After War... 
You know it's gonna be your night baby 
Love After War... 
You know the way that we fight baby 
Love After War... 
Just drink this glass of wine 
Love After War... 
And girl remember you're mine
