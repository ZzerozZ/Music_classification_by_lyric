                        Bài hát: Break My Heart - Hey Violet

I could not forget
All the wonderful things you've done
And I have no regrets
Done everything except for one
(Break my heart)
It's like a test, it's like a game
(Break my heart)
To see how much I can take
(Break my heart)
I'm curious to live and learn
(Break my heart)
So light me up and let me burn

Tell me you've never loved me
Tell me that it wasn't real
Just say you've found somebody else
I wanna know the way it feels
(Break my heart)
Tell me you've never loved me
Tell me it was just a lie
I wanna feel the pain
I wanna see the light

Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart

Pictures disappear
And every memory will fade
So cut me, baby, deep enough
So that the scar will stay
(Break my heart)
It's like a drug, I can't say no
(Break my heart)
On paradise I overdose
(Break my heart)
I'm curious to live and learn
(Break my heart)
So light me up and let me burn

Tell me you've never loved me
Tell me that it wasn't real
Just say you've found somebody else
I wanna know the way it feels
(Break my heart)
Tell me you've never loved me
Tell me it was just a lie
I wanna feel the pain
I wanna see the light

Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart

This can only end one way (yeah, yeah)
Just do it now, I don't wanna wait (it's okay)
This can only end one way (yeah, yeah)
Just do it now, I don't wanna wait (don't be afraid)
Break my heart

Tell me you've never loved me
Tell me it was just a lie
I wanna feel the pain
I wanna see the light

Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart

This can only end one way (yeah, yeah)
Just do it now, I don't wanna wait (it's okay)
This can only end one way (yeah, yeah)
Just do it now, I don't wanna wait (don't be afraid)
Break my heart
