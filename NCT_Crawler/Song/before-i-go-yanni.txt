Before-Pet Shop Boys
Album:Bilingual(1996)
The telephone's not answered
So many times you'll call
For many different reasons
So many tears will fall before

You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for

So many fears will haunt you
Deny them or regret
Some men will make you want to
And you will not forget before

You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for

There's a story of a man who loved too much
He ended up inside a prison cell
You've got to want to give to get it
Or you could land up in the same suspicious hell
It's happened before (Before Before Before)
It's happened before (Before Before)

Coincidence and patience
Will mend this fatal flaw
Though it may seem a long wait
Others have been here before

You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for

One day, when the phone starts ringing
You'll answer to the words you're longing for
No tears, no trade, no prison cell
Whatever you need, he will return more
It's happened before (Before Before Before)
It's happened before (Before Before)

You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for

You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
It's happened before (Before Before Before)
It's happened before (Before Before)
