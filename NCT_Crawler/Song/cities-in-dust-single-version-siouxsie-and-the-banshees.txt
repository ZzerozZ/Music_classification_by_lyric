                        Water was running, children were running
 You were running out of time
 Under the mountain, a golden fountain
 Were you praying at the Lares shrine? But ohh, oh your city lies in dust
 Ohh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend We found you hiding, we found you lying
 Choking on the dirt and sand
 Your former glories and all the stories
 Dragged and washed with eager hands But ohh, oh your city lies in dust, my friend
 Ohh, oh your city lies in dust, my friend
 Your city lies in dust Water was running, children were running
 We found you hiding, we found you lying
 Water was running, children were running
 We found you hiding, we found you lying Your city lies in dust, my friend
 Ohh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend Hot and burning in your nostrils
 Pouring down your gaping mouth
 Your molten bodies, blanket of cinders
 Caught in the throes And ohh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
 Ohh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
 Ohh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
 Ohh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
 Your city lies in dust, my friend
 Ohh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
 Ohh, oh, your city
