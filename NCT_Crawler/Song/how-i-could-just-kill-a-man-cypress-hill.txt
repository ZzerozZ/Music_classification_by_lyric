                        It's another one of them ol' funky Cypress Hill things
 You know whatI'msayin?
 And it goes like this Hey don't miss out on what you're passing
 You're missing the hoota of the funky Buddha
 Eluder or the *** up styles to get wicked
 So come on as cypress starts to kick it
 Cuz we're like the outlaw stridin suckers are hidin'
 Jump behind the bush when they see me driving
 By, hangin out my window
 And my magnum takin out some puto's
 Acting kinda loco, I'm just another local
 Kid from from the street getting paid for my vocals Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man I'm ignoring all the dumb ***
 Yo, because I bet it's comin' from it
 I'm not gonna waste no time
 Fuckin' around like I got ya hummin
 Hummin' comin' at cha
 And you know I had to gat ya Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
 I got the clearance to run the interference
 Into your satellite, shining a battle light
 Swing out the gat, and I know that will gat ya right
 Here's an example, just a little sample
 How I could just kill a man!
 One-time tried to come in my home
 Take my chrome, I said "Yo, it's on
 Take cover son, or you're ass-out
 How you like my chrome?", then I watched the rookie pass out
 Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway
 Hahaha, that young punk had to pay
 So I just killed a man! Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man It's gonna be a long time before I finish
 One of the many missions that I have to establish
 To light my spliff, ignite ya with these sights
 And if you ain't down: bull***!
 Say some punk try to get you for your auto
 Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
 No, I think you play like a thug
 Next hear the shot of a Magnum slug
 Hummin', comin' at cha
 Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
 How you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I've been
 Understand where I'm coming from
 When you're up on the hill, in your big home
 I'm out here, risking my dome
 Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
 Just to stay alive, aiyyo I gotta say "*** it"
 Here is something you can't understand
 How I could just kill a man Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man All I wanted was a Pepsi
