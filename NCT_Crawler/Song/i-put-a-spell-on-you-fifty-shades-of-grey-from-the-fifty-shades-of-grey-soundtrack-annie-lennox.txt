                        I put a spell on you
 'Cause you're mine

 You better stop the things you do
 I ain't lyin'
 No I ain't lyin'

 You know I can't stand it
 You're runnin' around
 You know better daddy
 I can't stand it cause you put me down
 Oh oh

 I put a spell on you
 Because you're mine
 Oh oh

 You know I can't stand it
 You're runnin' around
 You know better daddy
 I can't stand it cause you put me down
 Oh oh

 I put a spell on you
 Because you're mine

 You know I love you
 I love you
 I love you
 I love you anyhow
 And I don't care if you don't want me
 I'm yours right now

 I put a spell on you
 Because you're mine

 Because you're mine
 Because you're mine
 Oooh yeah
