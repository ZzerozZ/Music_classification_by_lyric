                        Let's go out, get lit, get loose tonight 
Sing a song, get wrong, make it feel alright 
Drinks on ice 
Stars in our eyes 
Ain't got a lot of money 
But you're a dime 

Hey hey 
All I need is a whole whole 
Lot of you everyday day's 
A holiday ain't nothing we can't do 
Now all I need baby 
Is a little time 
And a whole lot of you 

Get me buzzed on your love 
Lemme steal a kiss 
Bubblegum on your tongue 
No I can't resist 
Gotta leave all your worries at the door 
Cuz life ain't nothin but a big dance floor 

Nobody wanna be alone, alone tonight 
So come on baby take me home, home tonight 
So come on and take me home.
