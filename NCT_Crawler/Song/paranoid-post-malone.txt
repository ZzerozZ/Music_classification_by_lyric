Never know when someone come and try to take my life
I been sleeping with the .44 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashing lights
God damn they right behind me
And I wake up everyday, I wake up everyday with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates

And they following me
Two hundred bands under the floor of kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceiling
Even family and friends started switching
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'
Eyes open, I see you, I'm watching you, yeah

More people wanna be, you don't trust no one
Tell me why I can't get no relief
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I'll do what I can but it's out of my hands
Struggling just to find my peace
Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul like I'm Snowden

Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky

No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me what's the point in picking sides
Tell me why I can't get no relief
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans

I'll do what I can but it's out of my hands
Struggling just to find my peace
Mind is running all day
Cost me more than money and I'm paying the price, yeah
I ain't going nowhere
Killing myself so I can make me a life, yeah

Minute after minute
Never had a limit
Wake up every morning, knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted
You ain't lookin' in it
Either way I know they'll cover me again

Tell me why I can't get no relief
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I'll do what I can but it's out of my hands
Struggling just to find my peace
