                        Bài hát: Closer Beat - The Chainsmokers, Halsey

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you 
I drink too much and that's an issue 
But I'm Ok 
Hey, tell your friends it was nice to meet them 
But I hope I never see them again 

I know it breaks your heart 
Moved to the city in a broke down car 
And four years, no calls 
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar 
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop 
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop 

So baby pull me closer in the back seat of your Rover 
That I know you can't afford 
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder 
Pull the sheets right off the corner 
Of the mattress that you stole 
From your roommate back in Boulder 
We ain't ever getting older 

We ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 

You, look as good as the day I met you 
I forget just why I left you, I was insane 
Stay, and play that Blink-182 song 
That we beat to death in Tucson, OK 

I know it breaks your heart 
Moved to the city in a broke down car 
And four years, no call 
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar 
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop 
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop 

So baby pull me closer in the back seat of your Rover 
That I know you can't afford 
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder 
Pull the sheets right off the corner 
Of the mattress that you stole 
From your roommate back in Boulder 
We ain't ever getting older 

We ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 

So baby pull me closer in the back seat of your Rover 
That I know you can't afford 
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder 
Pull the sheets right off the corner 
Of the mattress that you stole 
From your roommate back in Boulder 
We ain't ever getting older 

We ain't ever getting older 
No, we ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
No, we ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
No, we ain't ever getting older (yeah) 

We ain't ever getting older (yeah) 
No, we ain't ever getting older 

We ain't ever getting older 
No we ain't ever getting older
