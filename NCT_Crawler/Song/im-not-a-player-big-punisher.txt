                        Yo, I ain't a player, I just *** a lot
 Jump on top of my dick and work them hips
 Until I bust a shot
 It doesn't stop, I'm only beginning
 I'm boning your women, while you home all alone
 I'm doing up in 'em
 Sending them back to you, mad at you
 Don't catch a motha' ***in' attitude, I'm just showing you
 How this rapper do
 Capital Punishment, when I'm up in there
 Suckin' it, bustin' it out, nice blouse
 Let me unbutton it
 You ***in' wit King Papi Chulo
 And knockin' culo, poppin' mooners out the socket
 Tryin' to ride wit the sumo
 You know my rhymes is high
 Word I be thrillin' 'em bitch be tryin' to ride
 But the curb be killin' 'em
 Fillin' 'em with the gas
 My G's premium unleaded, come get it, first work the tongue
 Then let the Pun hit it
 Split it in half
 Watch the gatt, baby take a bath, be good, I might put away the wood
 And give you the mustache I ain't a player, I just *** a lot
 I'm not a player, I just *** a lot
 I ain't a player, I just *** a lot
 I'm not a player, I just *** a lot I bang a stranger
 In my torture chamber, I'll feed the local poor child binga?
 While I force my finga whre my ballaz lingah
 I bring the pain like Method
 When I flex I'm flip the coochie, Puerto Rican to the core
 And no bootie but eat the pussy
 Excuse me for being blunt
 But I been eating cunts, since pimps is pushing
 Pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps
 Bumpin' and grindin'
 Simultaneously want it, climbing up the walls
 With my balls bangin' off your hymen
 I'm a diamond in the rough
 Bustin' in your face, taste the sweetness of my dick
 Rip your fetus out of place, yo
 Bitches already know the repertiore
 Step in my car, lets start the menage-a-toi
 Like Escobar
 By far,I'm the best at all sex positions
 Forget the kissin', I'm skippin' the tongue twistin'
 See, that's tradition I ain't a player, I just *** a lot
 I'm not a player, I just *** a lot
 I ain't a player, I just *** a lot
 I'm not a player, I just *** a lot Some chick in back of me
 Bought me a daiquiri, told me meet her in back of Zachary's
 'cause she heard I was packin' meat
 I bagged the freak
 And hit the tele, got the phillies, lifted her belly
 And put it in her mouth like Akinyele
 Far from ugly
 But they used to say I'm too chubby, but since the money
 The honies got nuthin' but love for me
 So rub my tummy and make a wish
 I'll make you rich, take your kids to the flicks
 Come back and fix your favorite dish
 Crazy bitch
 I ain't with that, I'mma hit that, split back to the shack
 Where my other chick's at
 Now can you dig that
 I'm the Mack doin' my thing, pulling your strings
 Making you feel like you in a dream
 It's the king of the hip-hop quotables
 Giving you multiples, just by the tone
 Of my voice and the vocables
 I notice you doin' your thing
 With your crew, is it aight if I come down there
 And sing to you I ain't a player, I just *** a lot
 I'm not a player, I just *** a lot
 I ain't a player, I just *** a lot
 I'm not a player, I just *** a lot
