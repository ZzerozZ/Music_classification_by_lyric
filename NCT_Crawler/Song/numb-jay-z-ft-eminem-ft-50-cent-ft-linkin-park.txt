                        I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface 
I don't know what you're expecting of me 
Put under the pressure, of walking in your shoes 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 

[Chorus:] 
I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
Become so tired, so much more aware 
I'm becoming this, all I want to do 
Is be more like me and be less like you 

Can't you see that you're smothering me? 
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control 
'Cause everything that you thought I would be 
Has fallen apart, right in front of you 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 
An' every second I waste is more than I can take 

[Chorus:] 
I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
Become so tired, so much more aware 
I'm becoming this, all I want to do 
Is be more like me and be less like you 

And I know 
I may end up failing too 
But I know 
You were just like me 
With someone disappointed in you 

[Chorus:] 
I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
Become so tired, so much more aware 
I'm becoming this, all I want to do 
Is be more like me and be less like you 

I've 
Become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
                        
                    |
