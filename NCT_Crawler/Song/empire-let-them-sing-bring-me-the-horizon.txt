                        It's the start of the end
 Surrender the throne
 The blood on my hands covered the holes We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
 Are we truly alone?
 The scars on your heart are yours to atone
 We've been surrounded
 Let 'em sing, let 'em sing The deeper you dig, the darker it gets
 There's nowhere else for us to go
 We live while we learn, and then we forget
 We'll never find our way back home
 Come on They came like moths to a flame
 You live like a house in a hurricane (The wolves are at my door) It's the start of the end
 Surrender the throne
 The blood on my hands covered the holes We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
 The end, are we truly alone?
 The scars on your heart are yours to atone
 We've been surrounded
 Let 'em sing, let 'em sing I hear them calling at the gates
 (Let us in, let us in)
 I hear them calling out my name (I don't care) Let them sing, let them sing, let them sing
 Let the bastards sing
 Let them sing, let them sing
 Let the bastards sing
 Let them sing, let them sing
 Let the bastards sing
 Let the God-forsaken bastards sing They came like moths to a flame
 You live like a house in a hurricane The wolves are at my door
 But I can see the writing on the wall
 The wolves are at my door
 Waiting for my empire to fall It's the start of the end
 Surrender the throne
 The blood on my hands covered the holes We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
 The end, and we're truly alone
 The scars on your heart are yours to atone
 We've been surrounded
 Let 'em sing, let 'em sing
