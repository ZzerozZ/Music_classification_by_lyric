                        Bài hát: Take U There - Skrillex, Diplo, Kiesza

[Verse:]
You show me there's something more to us
Than the same old thing, no usual affair
I will never dream of your love till you take me there
Till you take me there, ooh babe

[Chorus:]
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, love to give
Love to, love to, love to, love to, love, love, love, love

I will never dream of your love till you take me there

[Chorus:]
                        
                    |
