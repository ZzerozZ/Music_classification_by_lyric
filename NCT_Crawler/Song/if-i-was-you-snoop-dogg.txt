                        Ooh
Far East Movement
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Snoop Dogg
I bet you wake up in the morning and you kiss yourself
‘Cause I would, if I was you
I bet you show up to the club and just dance with yourself
‘Cause I would, if I was you
If I was you girl
Here is what I’d do girl
I’d notice me here at this table, with my crew girl
We sipping goose girl
We getting loose girl
So won’t you sit up on my lap with that caboose girl
Shake it out
You ain’t a doll, you’re a silver dolla
It’ll be a crime, if I didn’t holla
Take a second, hear me out
If you still don’t get it, let me spell it out
O-M-G, you’re so sexy
You know you caught my eye with a B-O-O-T-Y
O-M-G, shawty’s such a freak
She says she wants to go back to my C-O-N-D-O
Let’s go
Let’s go
I bet you hop under the covers and play with yourself
‘Cause I would, if I was you
I bet you stand up in the mirror and stare at yourself
‘Cause I would, if I was you
If I was you girl
It be me and you girl
Would be no question, teach you lessons in my room girl
And if you with it girl, then you can get it girl
And if you thinkin’ it, let’s start drinkin’, let it go girl
Check it out
You ain’t a doll, you’re a silver dolla
It’ll be a crime, if I didn’t holla
Take a second, hear me out
If you still don’t get it, let me spell it out
O-M-G, you’re so sexy
You know you caught my eye with a B-O-O-T-Y
O-M-G shawty’s such a freak
She says she wants to go back to my C-O-N-D-O
Let’s go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
