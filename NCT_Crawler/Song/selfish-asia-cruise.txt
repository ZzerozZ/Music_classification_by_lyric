                        Let's start by correcting ya tone
 Lower ya finger, don't be comin' at me
 With condescending demeanor
 We both know that ya dead wrong And what makes it worse
 You don't even have the nerve
 To ever say that you're sorry You're never wrong and I'm never right
 And you win all the rounds in every fight
 That's why Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
 You just keep getting your way
 You just keep getting your way, ya selfish So I decided not to get in your way
 It's time to do it my way
 And that means getting away from you, ya selfish How is it that you can look at us and only see you?
 You can look at one but never would you ever see two
 You can live a lie and never be true
 It's so funny now, how completely I can see you You're never wrong and I'm never right
 And you win all the rounds in every fight
 That's why Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
 You just keep getting your way
 You just keep getting your way, ya selfish So I decided not to get in your way
 It's time to do it my way
 And that means getting away from you, ya selfish No, we don't need to talk
 Ain't nothin' left to say
 You got everything ya want
 Go ahead and have ya cake I know what's best for me
 We go our separate ways
 Leaving you with everything
 Even all the pain Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
 You just keep getting your way
 You just keep getting your way, ya selfish So I decided not to get in your way
 It's time to do it my way
 And that means getting away from you, ya selfish
