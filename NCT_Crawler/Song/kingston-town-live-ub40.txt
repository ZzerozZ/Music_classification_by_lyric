                        The night seems to fade,
 But the moonlight lingers on
 There are wonders for everyone
 The stars shine so bright,
 But they're fading after dawn
 There is magic in kingston town

 [Chorus:]

 Oh kingston town,
 The place I long to be
 If I had the whole world
 I would give it away
 Just to see, the girls at play
 Ooh, ooh, ooh

 And when I am king,
 Surely I would need a queen
 And a palace and everything, yeah
 And now I am king,
 And my queen will come at dawn
 She'll be waiting in kingston town

 [Chorus:]

 And when I am king,
 Surely I would need a queen
 And a palace and everything, yeah
 And now I am king,
 And my queen will come at dawn
 She'll be waiting in kingston town
                        
                    |
