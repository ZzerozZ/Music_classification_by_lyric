                        Bài hát : One Love - Blue

It's kind a funny how life can change
Can flip 180 in a matter of days
Sometimes love works in mysterious ways
One day you wake up gone without a trace

I refused to give up
I refused to give in
You're my everything
I don't wanna give up
I don't wanna give in
Oh so everybody sing
One love for the mother's pride
One love for the times we cried
One love gotta stay alive
I will survive
One love for the city streets
One love for the hip hop beats
One love oh I do believe
One love is all we need

Late at night I'm still wide awake
Feel this is far more than I can take
I thought my heart could never break never break
Now I know that's one big mistake

I refused to give up
I refused to give in
You're my everything
I don't wanna give up
I don't wanna give in
Oh no 
Everybody sing
One love for the mother's pride
One love for the times we cried
One love gotta stay alive
I will survive
One love for the city streets
One love for the hip hop beats
One love oh I do believe
One love is all we need

Baby just love me love me love me
Baby just hold me hold me hold me oh
Love me love me love me oh yeah
One love
Baby just love me love me love me
Baby just hold me hold me hold me oh
Love me love me love me oh yeah

One love for the mother's pride
One love for the times we cried
One love gotta stay alive
Oh I will survive
One love for the city streets
One love for the hip hop beats
One love oh I do believe
One love is all we need (x2)
