                        Bài hát: The Weekend - SZA

You say you got a girl
And how you want me
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is wreckless
Of knowin' you're selfish
Knowin' I'm desperate

Gettin' all in your love
Fallin' all over love, like
Do it to last, last
Hanging out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home?
Is you out with her?

I don't care long as you're here by 10:30
No later than, drop them drawers
Give me what I want
My man is my man is your man
Her, this her man too
My man is my man is your man
Her, that's her man

Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way

Think I got it covered for the weekend
I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal is two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them
More of them, more of you on me
On us, just tell me you want me, yeah

Monday and I'll be at your door
Ready to take her place
Ready to give you
What you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for
10:30, no later than

Drop them drawers, I know what you want
My man is my man is your man
Her, this her man too
My man is my man is your man
Her, that's her man
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend

You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend
