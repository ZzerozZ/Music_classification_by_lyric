                        Bài hát: Mouth Of The River - Imagine Dragons

Oh the mouth of the river
Oh the mouth of the river
Oh the mouth of the river

I want to live a life like that
Live the life of the faithful one
Wanna bow to the floor
With everybody else want to be someone
I want to make some love
I don't want no enemies
It's the curse of a man
Always living life, living live, living just to please

Oh the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh the mouth of the river (woah)
Oh the mouth of the river (woah)
And the wrath of the giver (woah)
With the hands of a sinner (woah)
Oh the mouth of the river

Oh I'm alkaline
I'm always keeping to the basics
I'm overboard
I'm self-destructive
And self-important
And I'm anxious
Oh I'm self-assured
I'm nervous
And I'm pacing, oh I'm pacing

Oh the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh the mouth of the river (woah)
Oh the mouth of the river (woah)
And the wrath of the giver (woah)
With the hands of a sinner (woah)
Oh the mouth of the river

And I am going under
Oh I am going under
I am going under
Oh I am going under
I am going under
Oh I

Oh the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh the mouth of the river (woah)
Oh the mouth of the river (woah)
And the wrath of the giver (woah)
With the hands of a sinner (woah)
Oh the mouth of the river
