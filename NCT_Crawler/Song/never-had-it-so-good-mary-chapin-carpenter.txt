                        No one's got to tell me it's over
 I could see it from miles away
 No one's got to tell me
 What I don't already know today No one's got to tell me they've seen you
 On the town with an old girlfriend
 No one's got to tell me
 You look like you've fallen in love again 'Cause you're out of my life now
 With a wave of her hand
 You never had it so good babe
 I never had it so bad Now you can do what you want to
 And never feel sad
 You never had it so good babe
 I never had it so bad No one's got to tell me the difference
 Between me and the one who's returned
 No one's got to tell me
 You never really got over her No one's got to tell me they've seen you
 Looking like a brand new man
 No one's got to tell me
 You look like you've fallen in love again 'Cause you're out of my life now
 With a wave of her hand
 You never had it so good babe
 I never had it so bad Now you can do what you want to
 And never feel sad
 You never had it so good babe
 I never had it so bad So you just go where you go
 And do what you do
 And be who you want to be
 But when she burns you again
 And your phone doesn't ring
 Baby, it's me 'Cause you're out of my life now
 With a wave of her hand
 You never had it so good babe
 I never had it so bad Now you can do what you want to
 And never feel sad
 You never had it so good babe
 I never had it so bad
