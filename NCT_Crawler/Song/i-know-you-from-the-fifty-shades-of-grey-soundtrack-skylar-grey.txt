                        [Verse 1]
 I believe, I believe there's love in you
 Grid locked on the dusty avenues, 
 Inside your heart, just afraid to go
 I am more, I am more than innocent
 But just take a chance and let me in
 And I'll show you ways, that you don't know

 [Pre-Chorus]
 Don't complicate it, 
 Don't let the past dictate 
 Yeaaah!
 I have been patient
 But slowly I'm losing faith

 [Chorus]
 So please, I know you baby
 I know you baby
 So please, I know you baby
 I know you baby

 [Verse 2]
 I believe, I believe you could love me
 But you're lost on a road to misery
 And what I gave to you
 I can never get back! 
 Don't complicate it
 Don't drive yourself insane
 Yeaaah!
 Say what you will but I know that you want to stay! 

 [Chorus]
 So please, I know you baby
 I know you baby
 So please, I know you baby
 I know you baby

 [Bridge]
 Chemicals rushing in, 
 I know it's you that I belong to
 I'm fighting like a cannonball in the air
 Crushing into who I belong to
 Uuuh uh, uuuuh uuuuh uh

 I have been patient
 But slowly I'm losing faith

 [Chorus 2]
 Please, I know you baby
 I know you baby
 So please, I know you baby
 I know you baby
 Please, I know you baby
 I know you baby
 So please, I know you baby
 I know you baby
 (The shadows of your heart
 Are hanging in the sheets, waiting)
 I know you baby, I know you baby
 The secrets that you hide, come drown us
 And it's just like)
 I know you baby, I know you baby

 [Outro]
 The shadows of your heart
 Are hanging in the sheets, waiting
 I know you baby, I know you baby
 The secrets that you hide, come drown us
 And it's just like
 I know you baby, I know you baby
                        
                    |
