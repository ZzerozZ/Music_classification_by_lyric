Hey Jack, start that beat from the ti'nop
Yeah, 
Based on a T.R.U. Story, 
Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack
Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack

I got cr'nack, yeah, I got cr'nack
Got that cr'nack, yeah, I got cr'nack
Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack

Standing on them blocks, selling hi'nard
I be going dumb, I be going retard
Get no regard for no br'noad
Pi'nark my car, bitch I'm from Collipi'nark
Southside, outside, and I'm ridin' round, I get it
And I look around, they took my style
Like mothafucka you trippin'
Let me slow it down 'fore I get a ticket
Nigga want a verse from me, it's gon' cost a chicken
Rev your mirror, shake it like a stipper ho!
Car so big it got a stripper pole
I'm balling, ballin like a give and g'no
All I talk is crack, I can get the rico

Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack
Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack

I got cr'nack, yeah, I got cr'nack

Shawty got some real good P'nuss
If that *** stink, then she need to di'nush
No I'm not a killer but no p'nush
Get ***, get slugged, bet you won't even get up
This us, 2 guns in my Adidas
I'm from the A, you a C+
You niggas can't even see us
Ear muffs from Neimans...Marcus
I'm like c'mon let's start this
Keep it real my deparment
Versace my garment, yeah
I don't give a fi'nuck
I don't give a fi'nuck
Make her suck my di'nick, till that bitch hiccup
And when she call my phi'none, I won't even pick up

Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack
Started from the trap, now I rap

Thousand eight grams in my b'nag
I be making jewels, work be moving f'nast
And you need to mind your *** bi'naz
Get cash, get it fast, this a paper ti'nag
New car, you are not me forget it!
I got more hoes than four hoes
I had a foursome for Christmas!
Let me turn it down my baby mama listening
Extra garlic butter I got Benihana issues
Trigga finger itchin' like it's poison ivy
Going so hard Viagra trying to sign me
I might get an endorsement from baking soda
Catch me cooking crack trying to make a Rollie!

Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack
Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack

I got cr'nack, yeah, I got cr'nack
Got that cr'nack, yeah, I got cr'nack
Started from the trap, now I rap
