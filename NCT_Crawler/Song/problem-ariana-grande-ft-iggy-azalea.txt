                        Bài hát : Problem - Ariana Grande, Iggy Azalea

Baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya
I want you
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to
I want you
Tell me, tell me baby
Why did you leave me
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
But it's you
Know I shouldn't never call back
Or let you come back
But it's you
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
But it's you
                        
                    |
