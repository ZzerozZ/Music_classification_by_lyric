                        If only I could
 Get through this
 I get through this
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta make it, make it
 Make it through
 I'm gonna get through this
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta take my
 Take my mind off you

 Give me just a second
 And I'll be all right
 Surely one more moment
 Couldn't break my heart
 Give me till tomorrow
 Then It'll be okay
 Just another day and
 Then I'll hold you tight

 When your love is
 Pouring like the rain
 I close my eyes
 And it's gone again
 When will I get the chance
 To say I love you?
 I pretend that
 You're already mine and
 That my heart ain't
 Breaking every time
 I look into your eyes

 If only I could
 Get through this
 If only I could
 Get through this
 If only I could
 Get through this
 God, god gotta help me
 Get through this

 I gotta get through this
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta make it, make it
 Make it through
 Said I'm gonna
 Get through this
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta take my
 Take my mind off you

 Give me just a second
 And I'll be all right
 Surely one more moment
 Couldn't break my heart
 Give me till tomorrow
 Then It'll be okay
 Just another day and
 Then I'll hold you tight

 When your love is
 Pouring like the rain
 I close my eyes
 And it's gone again
 When will I get the chance
 To say I love you?
 I pretend that
 You're already mine and
 That my heart ain't
 Breaking every time
 I look into your eyes

 If only I could
 Get through this
 If only I could
 Get through this
 If only I could
 Get through this
 God, god gotta help me
 Get through this
 If only I could
 Get through this
 God, god gotta help me
 Get through this
 If only I could
 Get through this
 God, god gotta help me
 Get through this
 If only I could
 Get through this
