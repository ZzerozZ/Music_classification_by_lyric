                        You came into my Life one sunny day
I held you in my arms... no words to say
So beautiful and innocent as any child can be
Like fading to a dream so close to me

You asked my many things and taught me more
I'm sorry 'bout the years I closed the door... from you
But now I see before me a beautiful young girl
Still fading to a dream so close to me

Angel I can't take away the pain
I can only stand in rain
I'll be there with you

Angel take my hand I'll lead you to
A Sunny road where all is new
Like it used to be... my Angel
                        
                    |
