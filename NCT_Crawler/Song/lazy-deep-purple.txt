                        You're lazy you just stay in bed
 Oh you're lazy just stay in bed
 Don't want no money you don't want no bread If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw no
 If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
 You don't want to live don't want to cry no more Well my trying ain't done no good
 I said "My trying ain't done no good"
 You don't make no effort no not like you should Lazy you just stay in bed
 Lazy you stay in bed
 You don't want no money you don't want no bread
