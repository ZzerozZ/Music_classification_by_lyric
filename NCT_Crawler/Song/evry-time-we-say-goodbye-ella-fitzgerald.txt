                        Ev'ry time we say goodbye
 I die a little
 Ev'ry time we say goodbye
 I wonder why a little Why the Gods above me
 Who must be in the know
 Think so little of me
 They allow you to go When you're near
 There's such an air of spring about it
 I can hear a lark somewhere
 Begin to sing about it There's no love song finer
 But how strange the change
 From major to minor
 Ev'ry time we say goodbye When you're near
 There's such an air of spring about it
 I can hear a lark somewhere
 Begin to sing about it There's no love song finer
 But how strange the change
 From major to minor
 Ev'ry time we say goodbye
                        
                    |
