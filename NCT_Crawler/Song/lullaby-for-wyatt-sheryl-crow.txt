                        The world could fall apart
 But you're my heart, my dear
 I will sing this song
 'Til we are gone, my dear

 How do I keep you from losing your way
 Hope you'll go out and you'll come back some day
 But love is letting go
 And this I'll know

 Cause you were mine
 For a time

 I could shape your mind
 But why waste time, my dear
 There's so much more to know
 And I can show you dear

 How do I keep you from losing your way

 Hope you'll go out and you'll come back some day
 But love is letting go
 And this I'll know

 Cause you were mine
 For a time

 I have held you close
 And breathed your name, my dear
 I was with you then
 And will remain, my dear

 How do I keep you from losing your way
 Hope you will find love like I did some day
 But love is letting go
 And this I'll know

 Cause you were mine
 For a time
                        
                    |
