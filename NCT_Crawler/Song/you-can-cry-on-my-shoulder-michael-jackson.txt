                        Just because you know, I love you so much
 Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad
 Because you lost his love Though your love is not for me
 I don't wanna see you in misery
 So come on, baby, come on You can cry on my shoulder
 You can cry on my shoulder
 And bring all your troubles to me
 All your troubles to me Big girls ain't supposed to cry
 If you do I'll understand
 Maybe, I can show you
 How you can win his love again It may seem strange, I know
 But it's just that I love you
 So come on, baby, come on You can cry on my shoulder
 You can cry on my shoulder
 And bring all your troubles to me
 All your troubles to me Girl, you've given him all you had
 He'd better stop treating you so bad
 Come on, babe, come on, oh
 (Come on, come on, come on) You can cry on my shoulder
 Yes, you can, girl
 You can cry on my shoulder
 And bring all your troubles to me yeah babe Yes, you can now
 Ooh, ooh yes
 Yes, you can, girl
 I'll be there to help You can cry, you can cry
 You can cry, baby
 (You can cry on my shoulder)
 Ooh yeah, babe, yeah babe
 (You can cry on my shoulder)
 You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
