                        Bài hát: Tee Shirt - Birdy

In the morning when you wake up
I like to believe you are thinking of me
And when the sun comes through your window
I like to believe you’ve been dreaming of me

Dreaming mmm mmm

I know
'cause I'd spend half this morning
Thinking about the t-shirt you sleep in

I should know
'cause I'd spend all the whole day
Listening to your message I’m keeping and never deleting

When I saw you,
Everyone knew
I liked the effect that you had on my eyes

But no one else heard
The weight of your words
Or felt the effect that they have on my mind

Falling mmm mmm

I know
'cause I'd spend half this morning
Thinking about the t-shirt you sleep in

I should know
'cause I'd spend all the whole day
Listening to your message I’m keeping and never deleting
                        
                    |
