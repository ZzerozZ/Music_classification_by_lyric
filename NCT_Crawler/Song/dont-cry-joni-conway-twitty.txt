                        Don't cry Joni

(Chorus 1)
Jimmy, please say you'll wait for me
I ll grow up some day you ll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love for ever true.

Joni was the girl who lived next door
I ve known her, I guess, ten years or more
Joni wrote me a note one day
And this is what she had to say

(Chorus 1)

Slowly I read her note once more
Then I went over to the house next door
Her teardrops fell like rain that day
When I told Joni what I had to say.

(Chorus 2)
Joni, Joni,please don t cry
You ll forget me by and by
You re just fifteen, I m twenty-two
And Joni, I just can't wait for you.

Soon I left our little hometown
Got me a job and tried to settle down
But the words kept haunting my memory
The words that Joni said to me

(Chorus 1)

I packed my clothes and I caught a plane
I had to see Joni, I had to explain
How my heart was filled with her memory
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me

I ran all the way to the house next door
But things weren t like they were before.
My teardrops fell like rain that day
When I heard what Joni had to say

(Chorus 3)
Jimmy, Jimmy,please don t cry
You'll forget me by and by
It's been five years since you ve been gone
Jimmy, I married your best friend John
                        
                    |
