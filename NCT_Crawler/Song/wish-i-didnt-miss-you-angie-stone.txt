                        Same old story is back again
 She's not a lover, she's just a friend
 I'm sick and tired for you
 To blame on me Now you think it's funny
 Now you wanna spend your money
 On girls but you forgot when you were down
 That I was around Call my lover, hang up, call again
 What in the world is happening
 Listen in, but don't yell at me Isn't it ironic
 All you wanna do is smoke chronic?
 Boy, you forgot when you were down
 Who was around I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
 Waiting for love to walk through the door
 I wish I didn't miss you anymore Memories don't live like people do
 I'm sick for ever believing you
 Wish you'd bring back the man I knew
 Was good to me, oh, Lord Every time you say you're coming
 Boy, you disappoint me, honey
 How well you forgot when you were down
 And I was around I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
 Waiting for love to walk through the door
 I wish I didn't miss you anymore I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
 Waiting for love to walk through the door
 I wish I didn't miss you anymore One of these days, it's gonna happen to you
 Missing a love like I'm missing you, babe, yeah, yeah
 One of these days, when your dreams come true
 That's the one that's gonna do it to you, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
 Waiting for love to walk through the door
 I wish I didn't miss you anymore I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
 Waiting for love to walk through the door
 I wish I didn't miss you anymore I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
 Waiting for love to walk through the door
 I wish I didn't miss you anymore
