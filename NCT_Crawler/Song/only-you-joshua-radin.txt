                        Bài hát: Only You - Joshua Radin

Looking from the window above 
It's like a story of love 
Can you hear me? 
Came back only yesterday 
Who went further away 
Want you near me 

All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you 

Sometimes when I think of her name 
When it's only a game 
And I need you 
Listen to the words that you say 
It's getting harder to stay 
When I need you 

All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you 

This is gonna take a long time 
And I wonder what's mine 
Can't take no more 

Wonder if you'll understand 
It's just the touch of your hand 
Behind a closed door 

All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you
                        
                    |
