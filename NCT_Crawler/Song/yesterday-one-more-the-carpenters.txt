                        When I was young 
I'd listen to the radio 
Waiting for my favorite songs 
When they played I'd sing along 
It made me smile. 

Those were such happy times 
And not so long ago 
How I wondered where they'd gone 
But they're back again 
Just like a long lost friend 
All the songs I loved so well. 

Every Sha-la-la-la 
Every Wo-o-wo-o 
Still shines 
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling 
That they're starting to sing's 
So fine. 

When they get to the part 
Where he's breaking her heart 
It can really make me cry 
Just like before 
It's yesterday once more. 

Looking back on how it was 
In years gone by 
And the good times that I had 
Makes today seem rather sad 
So much has changed. 

It was songs of love that 
I would sing to then 
And I'd memorize each word 
Those old melodies 
Still sound so good to me 
As they melt the years away. 

Every Sha-la-la-la 
Every Wo-o-wo-o 
Still shines 
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling 
That they're starting to sing's 
So fine. 

All my best memories 
Come back clearly to me 
Some can even make me cry. 

Just like before 
It's yesterday once more.
