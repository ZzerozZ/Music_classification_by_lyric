                        Bài hát: Nothing On You - Boyce Avenue

Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn’t worry about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you

If I wrote you a symphony,
Just to say how much you mean to me (what would you do?)
If I told you, you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular (tell me, would you?)
Well, baby I’ve been around the world
But I ain’t seen myself another girl (like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there’s just one thing I need from you (say “I do”)

Cause there are beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn’t worry about what they say
Cos they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote (what would you do?)
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team (tell me, would you?)
What’s the point of waiting anymore?
Cause girl I’ve never been more sure (baby, it’s you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you’ve been waiting for

Cause there are beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn’t worry about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you

Here we go, come with me
There’s a world out there that we should see
Take me hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I’m a rocketeer
Let’s fly

oh.. oh..
Let’s fly
                        
                    |
