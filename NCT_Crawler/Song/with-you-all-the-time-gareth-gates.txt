                        I live beneath the heart
I watch you from the dark
I'm every breath I'm every dream
I've known you forever
I've followed you everywhere
I'm every scar I'm who you are
When you think you're alone
When you cry cos the world's unfair
You can rest assured I'm always there

Even when you feel like you don't belong
Even when you fall and it all goes wrong
You know that I'm with you 
That I'm with you all the time

Say a little prayer for the restless heart
We shall never ever drift apart
Know that I'm with you 
Know that I'm with you 
With you all the time

I'm walking round the room
I'm laughing when you smile
And when you cry I cry too
I made you a promise
That I shall forever keep
You're on your own but not alone
When you're down and you're out
And the world tells you no-one cares
You can rest assured I'm always there

Even when you feel like you dont belong
Even when you fall and it all goes wrong
You know that I'm with you 
That I'm with you all the time

Say a little prayer for the restless heart
We shall never ever drift apart
Know that I'm with you 
Know that I'm with you 
With you all the time

Save a little love for me
You'll see
Save a little love for me
You'll see
Save a little love for me
You'll see
And you'll see

Even when you feel like you dont belong
Even when you fall and it all goes wrong
You know that I'm with you 
That I'm with you all the time

Say a little prayer for the restless heart
We shall never ever drift apar
Know that I'm with you 
Know that I'm with you 
With you all the time

You know that I'm with you 
That I'm with you all the time

Say a little prayer for the restless heart
We shall never ever drift apart
Know that I'm with you 
Know that I'm with you 
With you all the time
                        
                    |
