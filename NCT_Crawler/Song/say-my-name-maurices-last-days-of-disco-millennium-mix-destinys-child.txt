                        Chorus
 Say my name, say my name
 If no one is around you, say "baby I love you"
 If you ain't runnin' game
 Say my name, say my name
 You actin' kinda shady
 Ain't callin me baby
 Why the sudden change?
 Say my name, say my name
 If no one is around you, say "baby I love you"
 If you ain't runnin' game
 Say my name, say my name
 You actin' kinda shady
 Ain't callin me baby
 Better say my name

 Verse
 Any other day I would call, you would say
 "Baby how's your day?"
 But today it ain't the same
 Every other word is uh huh, yeah okay
 Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
 If you took it there, first of all, let me say
 I am not the one to sit around and be played
 So prove yourself to me
 I'm the girl that you claim
 Why don't you say the thangs
 That you said to me yesterday?

 Bridge
 I know you say that I am assuming things
 Something's going down that's the way it seems
 Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
 If nobody's holding you back from me
 Cause I know how you usually do
 When you say everything to me times two
 Why can't you just tell the truth?
 If somebody's there then tell me who

 Chorus
 Say my name, say my name
 If no one is around you, say "baby I love you"
 If you ain't runnin' game
 Say my name, say my name
 You actin' kinda shady
 Ain't callin me baby
 Why the sudden change?
 Say my name, say my name
 If no one is around you, say "baby I love you"
 If you ain't runnin' game
 Say my name, say my name
 You actin' kinda shady
 Ain't callin me baby
 Better say my name

 Verse
 What's up with this?
 Tell the truth, who you with
 How would you like it if I came over with my clique
 Don't try to change it now
 Sayin' you gotta bounce
 When two seconds ago, you said you just got in the house
 It's hard to believe that you
 Are at home, by yourself
 When I just heard the voice
 Heard the voice of someone else
 Just this question
 Why do you feel you gotta lie?
 Gettin' caught up in your game
 When you can not say my name

 Bridge
 I know you say that I am assuming things
 Something's going down that's the way it seems
 Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
 If nobody's holding you back from me
 Cause I know how you usually do
 When you say everything to me times two
 Why can't you just tell the truth?
 If somebody's there then tell me who

 Chorus
 Say my name, say my name
 If no one is around you, say "baby I love you"
 If you ain't runnin' game
 Say my name, say my name
 You actin' kinda shady
 Ain't callin me baby
 Why the sudden change?
 Say my name, say my name
 If no one is around you, say "baby I love you"
 If you ain't runnin' game
 Say my name, say my name
 You actin' kinda shady
 Ain't callin me baby
 Better say my name
