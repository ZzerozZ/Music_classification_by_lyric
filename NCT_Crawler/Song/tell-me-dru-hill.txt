                        [Chorus: x2]
 Tell me what you want
 Tell me what you need
 Tell me if it ain't good enough for ya babe
 Tell me Listen baby
 Anything is possible
 Anytime you want it girl let me know
 I won't ask why just let it flow Do your thing baby take control
 On my knees just say the word
 No request is gonna go unheard
 I'll take my time when I'm loving you
 Foreplay at one won't end till two [Chorus: x2] Candlelight we're alone
 I'm up in your mix if you put me on
 Talk to me I'll understand
 Your need to feel a gentle hand Now girl it's not my style, I can not lie
 You know I like to serve it on the freaky side
 What you want I can't ignore
 So tell me what your lookin for, yeah [Chorus: x2] And you know, you know
 When I lay you down
 I can hear your body speak
 Telling me to kiss you till your knees get weak All night working that, working that, working that body baby
 In the bed, or the middle of the floor baby
 My love is guaranteed to make you go crazy
 Said I don't need nothing wrong
 With loving you all night long [Chorus: x2]
                        
                    |
