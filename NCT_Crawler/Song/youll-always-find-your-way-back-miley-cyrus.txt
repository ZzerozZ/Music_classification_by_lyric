                        You wake up it's raining and its Monday
looks like one of those rough days
times up your late again so get out the door
sometimes you feel like running
find a whole new life and jump in
let go get up and hit the dance floor
when the lights go down its the ending of the show
and your feeling like you've got no where to go
don't you know
(chorus)
you can change your hair. you can change clothes
you can change your mind , thats just the way it goes
you can say goodbye and you can say hello
but you'll always find your way back home
you can change your style you can change your jeans
you can learn to fly and you chase your dreams
you can laugh and cry but everybody knows
you'll always find your way back home

your best friends your little home town
waiting up where ever you go now
you know that you can always turn around
cuz' this world is big and its crazy
and this girl is thinking that maybe
that this life is what some people dream about
cuz' when I'm feeling down
and I'm all alone
I've always got a place were i can go
cuz' i know

chorus)
you can change your hair. you can change clothes
you can change your mind , thats just the way it goes
you can say goodbye and you can say hello

but you'll always find your way back home
you can change your style you can change your jeans
you can learn to fly and you chase your dreams
you can laugh and cry but everybody knows
you'll always find your way back home
and they know exactly who you are
where the real you is a superstar
you know its never to far away

you can change your hair. you can change clothes
you can change your mind , thats just the way it goes
you can say goodbye and you can say hello
but you'll always find your way back home

you can change your hair. you can change clothes
you can change your mind , thats just the way it goes
you can say goodbye and you can say hello
but you'll always find your way back home

you can change your style you can change your jeans
you can learn to fly and you chase your dreams
you can laugh and cry but everybody knows
you'll always find your way back home

you'll always find your way back home

you'll always find your way back home

you'll always find your way back home

you'll always find your way back home

you'll always find your way back home
