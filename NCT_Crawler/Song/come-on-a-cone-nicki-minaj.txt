                        B-tches they serious
Yeah these b-tches delirious
All this b-tches inferious
I just pimp my interiors
I just pick up and go
Might pick up a hoe
Might give conversations
If you kick up the dough
Never mind my money
Never mind my stats
Every bitch wanna be me
You can find them in sacks
Pink Friday two Milli
Superbass triple plat
When you see me on Ellen
Just admit that I'm winning
Do a show for Versace
They request me by name
And if they don't get Nicki
It just won't be the same
When I'm sitting with Anna
I'm really sitting with Anna
Aint a metaphor, punchline
I'm really sittin with Anna
Front row at Oscar De La Renta, posture
Aint a bitch that could do it, not even my imposter
Put these bitches on lockout, where the f*ck is your roster
I pull up in that new new, marinara and pasta

[Chorus]
Shake my head, yo I'm mad, aint a bitch in my zone
In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
Got the certification, cause it come with the stone
But this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
That * come on a cone, it should come on a cone
And my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
That * come on a cone, it should come on a cone
Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone


7up went and gave, my commercial to Cee-Lo
But dont tell 'em I said it, lets keep it on the d-low
If you need you a look, just put me on your song
But you know it'll cost, about 6 figures long
But you bitches ain't got it, where the f*ck is your budgets
Flying spurs for hers means i'm fuckin above it
And I just got a ghost and i'm callin it Casper
But this * is so cold it belong in Alaska
Why da f*ck i'm I stylin I competes with myself
When u win against Nicki u depleted your wealth
And i'm not masturbating but i'm feelin myself
Paparazzi is waitin cuz them pictures would sell
Yeah now dont you feel stupid yeah dats egg on your face
If you wasn't so ugly i'd put my d*ck in your face
D*ck in your face put my d*ck in your face

[Chorus]
Shake my head, yo I'm mad, aint a bitch in my zone
In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
Got the certification, cause it come with the stone
But this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
That * come on a cone, it should come on a cone
And my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
That * come on a cone, it should come on a cone
Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

Oo-ooh d*ck in your face
Oo-ooh d*ck in your face
Oo-ooh d*ck in your face
Put my d*ck in your face
Put my d*ck in your face yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
