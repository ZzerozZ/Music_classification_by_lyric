                        Bài hát: Lionhearted - Porter Robinson, Urban Cone

Flipping out the light trying to survive this endless fight
If we shoot them down, we can make it right, we'll make it right
And they light the sky as they multiply, they multiply
No matter what they try, they won't take away our will to fight
If we shoot them down, we can make it right, we'll make it right

They broke the walls we guarded
But we don't care about it
We'll finish what we started
So promise me that
We'll be the lionhearted
For we don't care about it
We'll finish what we started
So promise me that they'll fall

So promise me that

No matter what they try, they won't take away our will to fight
If we shoot them down, we can make it right, we'll make it right
And up against all odds, take a thousand lives, a thousand lives
So if you shoot them down, we can make it right, we'll make it right

They broke the walls we guarded
But we don't care about it
We'll finish what we started
So promise me that
We'll be the lionhearted
For we don't care about it
We'll finish what we started
So promise me that
They'll fall
So promise me that
They'll fall

We'll finish what we started
We'll be the lionhearted
They broke the walls we guarded
But we don't care about it
We'll finish what we started
We'll be the lionhearted
They broke the walls we guarded
So promise me that

They broke the walls we guarded
But we don't care about it
We'll finish what we started
So promise me they'll fall
                        
                    |
