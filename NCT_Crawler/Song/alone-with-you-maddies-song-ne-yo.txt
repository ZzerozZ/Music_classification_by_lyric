Title: Alone With You (Maddie's Song)
Artist: Ne-Yo

Don’t you ever let it cross your mind
That I wouldn’t gladly climb
Any mountain you could find
Just to be with you girl
And don’t you ever let your heart believe
That I wouldn’t happily
Swim across whatever sea
Just to be alone with you
Just to be alone with you
Just to be alone with you
Just to be alone with you
Don’t you even for a single day
Think that I would ever play
With your heart and throw it away
See I want to be with you
And if there ever was a single doubt
Somewhere in your mind about.. me
This should help you figure out
What I do, to be alone with you
Just to be alone with you
Baby just to be alone with you
Just to be alone with you
Baby just to be alone with you
Just to be alone with you
Baby just to be alone with you
Just to be alone with you
Ooooo
Lalalalalalalalalala...
Lalalalalalalalalala...
Lalalalalalalalalala...
Said sing it with me now
Lalalalalalalalalala...
Lalalalalalalalalala...
Lalalalalalalalalala...
Just to be alone with you you
Baby just to be alone with you
Just to be alone with you you
Baby just to be alone with you babe
Just to be alone with you
Just to be alone with you, you babe
Just to be alone with you
Baby just to be alone with you babe
With you babe
With you baby
Lalalalala...
Lalalala...
Lalalalalala...
