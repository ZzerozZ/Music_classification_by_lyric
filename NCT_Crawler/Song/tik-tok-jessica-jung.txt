                        Bài hát: Tik Tok - Jessica Jung

Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like P-Diddy (hey what's up girl) 
Grab my glasses I'm out the door I'm gonna hit the city (let's go) 
Before I leave brush ma teeth with a bottle of Jack 
'Cause when I leave for the night I ain't comin' back 

I'm talking pedicure on our toes toes 
Trying on all our clothes clothes 
Boys blowin' up our phones phones 

Drop top and playin' our favorite CD's 
Pullin' up to the parties 
Tryna get a little bit tipsy 

[CHORUS] 
Don't stop, make it pop 
DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, Imma fight 
'Til we see the sunlight 
TiK ToK, on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
Whoa-oh oh oh 
Whoa-oh oh oh 

Don't stop, make it pop 
DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, Imma fight 
'Til we see the sunlight 
TiK ToK, on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
Whoa-oh oh oh 
Whoa-oh oh oh 

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer 
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here 
Now, the dudes are lining up cause they hear we got swagger 
But we kick em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger 

I'm talkin' bout - everybody getting crunk, crunk 
Boys tryna touch my junk, junk 
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk 
Now, now - we goin' 'til they kick us out, out 
Or the police shut us down, down 
Police shut us down, down 
Po-po shut us - (down)-man 

[CHORUS] 
Don't stop, make it pop 
DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, Imma fight 
'Til we see the sunlight 
TiK ToK, on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
Whoa-oh oh oh 
Whoa-oh oh oh 

Don't stop, make it pop 
DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, Imma fight 
'Til we see the sunlight 
TiK ToK, on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
Whoa-oh oh oh 
Whoa-oh oh oh 

[BRIDGE] 
DJ, You build me up 
You break me down 
My heart, it pounds 
Yeah, you got me 
With my hands up 
You got me now 
You got that sound 
Yeah, you got me 

You build me up 
You break me down 
My heart, it pounds 
Yeah, you got me 
With my hands up 
Put your hands up 
Put your hands up 
Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in 

[CHORUS] 
Don't stop, make it pop 
DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, Imma fight 
'Til we see the sunlight 
TiK ToK, on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
Whoa-oh oh oh 
Whoa-oh oh oh 

Don't stop, make it pop 
DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, Imma fight 
'Til we see the sunlight 
TiK ToK, on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
Whoa-oh oh oh 
Whoa-oh oh oh
