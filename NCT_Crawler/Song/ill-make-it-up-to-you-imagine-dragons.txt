                        Bài hát: I'll Make It Up To You - Imagine Dragons

Took your heart, took your hand
Promise you all that I had
Hoping that you understand
I'm far from a perfect man

'Cause honey it's been a hard year
It seems like we're going nowhere
You're crying inside your bedroom
Baby I know it's not fair

Lay with me, for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right

I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night
I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night
I'll make it up to you

I know you don't understand
The vices that follow a man
And in your eyes I can see
The places that you'd rather be

'Cause honey it's been a hard year
It seems like we're going nowhere
You're crying inside your bedroom
Baby I know it's not fair

I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night
I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night
I'll make it up to you

In my darkest hour, in the dead of the night
I'll make it up to you
Your hands are mine
I'll make it up to you
Promises are nothing more than fleeting thoughts
But you, you are my lifeline

I'll make it up to you
Every night
I'll make it up to you
Every night
I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night
I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night
I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night
I'll make it up to you
                        
                    |
