                        Now on the scale of one to ten, I been rated, a 12 (right!)
 You know this and these cats hate it
 I got nuttin' outdated, if it is it's upgraded
 S-class wit everything voice-activated
 Chrome rims three bladed, factory custom made it
 Paid wit big faces; if it's broke then replace it
 Now it's like that; Purple Haze and Cognac
 On the beach in L.A. with dime bitches ridin' my back I represent them street niggas
 When they get hot, carry the heat niggas
 Them sweet niggas off they feet niggas
 You livin' on the edge, fleet nigga
 That's why my clique we do or die and roll deep nigga
 Ain't nothing sweet nigga, recognize the bloody clothes
 Ready to represent the Grove wit two calicoes
 I carry 4's in my side pocket
 While yours cock a nigga mind poppin'
 Walk through you house wit my iron now when I'm doing this one for my niggas
 Who be keepin' it tight
 Only lovin' dime bitches that *** on the first night
 This is for my bitches
 Wit the style and grace
 Who ain't hearin' nuttin' talkin' but the Benjamin face I'm doing this one for my niggas
 Who be keepin' it tight
 Only lovin' dime bitches that *** on the first night
 This is for my bitches
 Wit the style and grace
 Who ain't hearin' nuttin' talkin' but the Benjamin face I ain't bullshittin' I trick 'em and run up in their kitten
 And she ain't a nine or betta, my niggas then I'm splitin'
 Get a code-red hop in the Jag and fled
 Pumpin' Nore number six, "bitch give me some head"
 And for you niggas out there who be jacking the wrist
 Got a new group for ya, Nina Ross and the Clipse
 And from the hip I shoot, if you wanna get loot
 Bout ta tell ya the truth
 I'm more focused I'm born in the Lou' I'm doing this one for my niggas
 Who be keepin' it tight
 Only lovin' dime bitches that *** on the first night
 This is for my bitches
 Wit the style and grace
 Who ain't hearin' nuttin' talkin' but the Benjamin face I'm doing this one for my niggas
 Who be keepin' it tight
 Only lovin' dime bitches that *** on the first night
 This is for my bitches
 Wit the style and grace
 Who ain't hearin' nuttin' talkin' but the Benjamin face I ain't no busta nigga
 Came up out that Holly Grove dungeon nigga
 Flame up and toast let it get sparkin' up in here
 You don't make out alive very often up in here
 I'mma speak on behalf of the C.M.B. partna
 I'm a sweep off ya air if its any beef partna
 I skeet off a bag of the dilly-D partna
 Slip me on a mask hit the Benz wit three choppers
 Weezy-wez partna Four karats in my earring, five around my knuckle
 Six wrap the wrist, check the belt buckle
 Leave them wit it look like Nelly I didn't know
 If you was the Jackie Frost why didn't you say so
 Somebody gotta shine my nigga why not me
 Even my dentist told me floss 7 days a week
 Freeza burnt out the piece, Gucci, and hat, sneaks
 Butter soft leather seats for trash talkin' freaks I'm doing this one for my niggas
 Who be keepin' it tight
 Only lovin' dime bitches that *** on the first night
 This is for my bitches
 Wit the style and grace
 Who ain't hearin' nuttin' talkin' but the Benjamin face I'm doing this one for my niggas
 Who be keepin' it tight
 Only lovin' dime bitches that *** on the first night
 This is for my bitches
 Wit the style and grace
 Who ain't hearin' nuttin' talkin' but the Benjamin face I'm doing this one for my niggas
 Who be keepin' it tight
 Only lovin' dime bitches that *** on the first night
 This is for my bitches
 Wit the style and grace
 Who ain't hearin' nuttin' talkin' but the Benjamin face I'm doing this one for my niggas
 Who be keepin' it tight
 Only lovin' dime bitches that *** on the first night
 This is for my bitches
 Wit the style and grace
 Who ain't hearin' nuttin' talkin' but the Benjamin face I'm doing this one for my niggas
