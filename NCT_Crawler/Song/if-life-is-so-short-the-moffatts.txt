                        If Life Is So Short

Isn't it funny
How times seems to slip away
So fast
One minute you're happy
The other you're sad
But if you give me one more chance
To show my love for you is true
I'll stand by your side
Your whole life trough

If life is short
Why won't you let me love you
Before we run out of time
If love is so strong
Why won't you take the chance
Before our time has come
If life is so short
If life is so short

Love is a word that explains
How I feel for you
And when you're in my arms
All my dreams come true
And when you're not around
You can't hardly see
These tears that I'm crying
Now are for you to be with me

If life is short
Why won't you let me love you
Before we run out of time
If love is so strong
Why won't you take the chance
Before our time has come
If life is so short
If life is so short
                        
                    |
