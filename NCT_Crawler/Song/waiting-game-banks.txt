                        I'm thinking it over
 The way you make me feel all sexy but it's causing me shame
 I wanna lean on your shoulder
 I wish I was in love but I don't wanna cause any pain
 And if I'm feeling like I'm even, we've got nothing to gain What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage
 Don't tell me listen to your song because it isn't the same
 I don't wanna say your love is a waiting game Baby I'm thinking it over
 What if the way we started made it something cursed from the start
 What if it only gets colder
 Would you still wrap me up and tell me that you think this was smart
 'Cause lately I've been scared of even thinking 'bout where we are What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage
 Don't tell me listen to your song because it isn't the same
 I don't wanna say your love is a waiting game What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage
 Don't tell me listen to your song because it isn't the same
 I don't wanna say your love is a waiting game
