                        [Hook: Adam Levine] 
My life, my life 
Makes me wanna run away 
There's no place to go 
No place to go 
All the confusion 
It's an illusion like a movie 
Got nowhere to go 
Nowhere to run and hide 
No matter how hard I try 

[Verse 1: 50 Cent] 
Yeah '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich 
Man their emotions change so I can never trust a bitch 
I tried to help niggas get on 
They turned around and spit 
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick 
Now when you hear em it may sound like it's some other *** 
Cause I'm not writing anymore 
They not making hits 
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned 
If money's evil look at all the evil I done earned 
I'm doing what I'm supposed to 
I'm a writer, I'm a fighter 
Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer 
Watch me maneuver 
What's it to ya 
The track I lace it, it's better than basic 
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid 

[Hook] 

[Verse 2: Eminem] 
While you were sipping your own Kool-Aid, getting your buzz heavy 
I was in the *** shed sharpening my machete 
Sipping on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready 
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-get-even 
I think you *** meatballs keep on just forgetting 
Thought he was finished, mother***er it's only the beginning 
He's bugging again, he's straight thugging 
*** who he's offending 
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plu~gged in the 
Mother*** wall with 3000 volts of electricity 
Now take the other end of em 
Then plug them mother***ers-in-each 
One of your eye sockets 
Cause I thought you might finally *** see 
That'll teach you to go voicing your cocksucking opinion to me 
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this *** 
*** letting up, you’re gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me 
Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah it's happening again 
I'm thinking about just saying 
Mother *** everybody that's up in this bitch but 50 
Cause this is all I know 
This is why so hard I go 
I swear to God I put my heart and soul in this more than anybody knows 
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap 
But everytime I rap I'm more trapped 
And I rap myself right to this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap 
It's like a vicious cycle 
My life's in a crisis 
Christ how was I supposed to know *** would turn up like it did 
Feels like I'm going psycho again 
And I might just blow my lid 
*** I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid 
Cause I'm running in circles with 

[Hook] 

[Verse 3: 50 Cent] 
I haven't been this *** confused since I was a kid 
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did 
Maybe this is for me, maybe 
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy 
Maybe I'll do it 3 AM in the morning like Shady 
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter 
Try to say this ain't classic, get your ass kicked mad quick 
Wrap your head up in plastic pussy 
Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots 
It's tragic, it's sad it's 
Never gonna end, now we number one again 
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate 
Accept it, respect it 
This a gift God-given, like the air in the lungs 
Of every *** thing living
[Hook: Adam Levine]
