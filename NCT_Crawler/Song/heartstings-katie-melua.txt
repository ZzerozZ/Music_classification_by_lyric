                        Bài hát: Heartstings - Katie Melua

Is it a game, or is it a show?
We don't really care, we don't really give a damn.
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings.

For life or a day, for real or pretend,
If I had my way, this feeling would never end.
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings.

You're asking me not to leave you,
And baby that makes me smile.
Let's get our house with a sea-view
Forever or just for a little while.

We'll drink some champagne, we'll look at the stars
And do it again cause baby the world is ours.
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings.

Sometimes I think we're only,
On a day trip to Disneyland.
But remember that night you got lonely
And asked my daddy for my hand.

Having a bite, having a ball,
Talking all night and dancing until we fall.
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings.

You don't call me for days, heaven forbid,
The next thing you say you want me to have your kids.
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings.
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings.
