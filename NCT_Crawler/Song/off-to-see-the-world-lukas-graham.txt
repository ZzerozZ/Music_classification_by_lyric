                        Bài hát: Off To See The World - Lukas Graham

So, we wanna stay 
But can't find peace while sittin' still 
I guess we never will 
We're on the way 
We won't hurry back again 
The journey is the end (oh) 

I love this very moment 
We're speedin' up, not slowin' 
We might know we can't win 
But we're dumb enough to try 
We're going, there's no maybe 
That's why they call us crazy 
And we'll say if anybody asks us 

"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" 
We're off to see the world 
We don't need to know (oh) 
"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" 
We're off to see the world 
We don't need to know 

We never need to know 
Seekin' boundaries to break 
Let's forget the ones we've made 
So we carry on 
Don't let good things pass us by 
The time we're gone will be the best time of our life 

I love this very moment 
We're speedin' up, not slowin' 
We might know we can't win 
But we're dumb enough to try 
We're going, there's no maybe 
That's why they call us crazy 
And we'll say if anybody asks us 

"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" 
We're off to see the world 
We don't need to know (oh) 
"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" 
We're off to see the world 
We don't need to know 

So go tell 'em we won't stop 
We know they can't change us 
We're gonna go way off the map 
To get ourselves back on the track 

Go tell 'em we won't stop 
We know they can't change us 
No need to worry so much 
We do whatever we want (oh) 

"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" 
We're off to see the world 
We don't need to know (oh) 
"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" 
We're off to see the world 
We don't need to know (oh) 

Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
