                        Come one Let's talk about sex, baby
 Let's talk about you and me
 Let's talk about all the good things
 And the bad things that may be
 Let's talk about sex
 Let's talk about sex
 Let's talk about sex
 Let's talk about sex Let's talk about sex for now
 To the people at home or in the crowd
 It keeps coming up anyhow
 Don't decoy, avoid, or make void the topic
 'Cause that ain't gonna stop it
 Now we talk about sex on the radio and video shows
 Many will know anything goes
 Let's tell it how it is, and how it could be
 How it was, and of course, how it should be
 Those who think it's dirty have a choice
 Pick up the needle, press pause, or turn the radio off
 Will that stop us, Pep? I doubt it
 All right then, come on, Spin Let's talk about sex, baby
 Let's talk about you and me
 Let's talk about all the good things
 And the bad things that may be
 Let's talk about sex
 Let's talk about sex
 Let's talk about sex
 Let's talk about sex Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
 She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
 Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
 The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'
 Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
 Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
 Her dates heads of state, men of taste
 Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
 Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
 And believe me, you, it's as good as true
 There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
 She had it all in the bag
 So she should have been glad
 But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
 Thinkin' about the things that she never had
 No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
 That last night was dope, dope Take it easy now Let's talk about sex, baby (sing it)
 Let's talk about you and me (sing it, sing it)
 Let's talk about all the good things
 And the bad things that may be
 Let's talk about sex (come on)
 Let's talk about sex (do it)
 Let's talk about sex (uh-huh)
