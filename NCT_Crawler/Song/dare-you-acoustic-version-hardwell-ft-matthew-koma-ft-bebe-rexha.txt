                        Bài hát: Dare You (Acoustic Version) - Hardwell, Matthew Koma, Bebe Rexha

We're a million lonely people
All together on this needle in the sky
Afraid of heights
And your dreams were made illegal
By the laws of lesser evil we call life
But not tonight
I dare you to love
I dare you to cry
I dare you to run
I dare you to try
I dare you to fall
And lay on the ground
I dare you to feel
I dare you to be here now
You're an outline of a vision
That you had when we were children yesterday
You watch it fade
Let your heart be your religion
Let it break you out of this prison you became
It's not too late
I dare you to love
I dare you to cry
I dare you to run
I dare you to try
I dare you to fall
And lay on the ground
I dare you to feel
I dare you to be here now
I dare you
I dare you
                        
                    |
