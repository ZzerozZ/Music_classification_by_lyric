                        I was so in love with you
 You rarely see a love that true
 Wasn't that enough for you?
 Wasn't that enough for you? I would climb a mountain
 I wouldn't want to see you fall
 Rock climb for you
 And give you a reason for it all You kept on thinking
 You were the only one
 Too busy thinking
 Love is a gun Hit me like a slow bullet
 Like a slow bullet
 It took me some time to realize it You kept on thinking
 You were the only one
 Too busy thinking
 Love is a gun I know the end
 Before the story's been told
 It's not that complicated
 But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul You kept on thinking
 You were the only one
 Too busy thinking
 Love is a gun I know the end
 Before the story's been told
 It's not that complicated
 But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul You were trigger happy, baby
 You never warned me, let me free
 It's not that complicated
 But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul Think you got it
 But you got all the trouble you need
 I came in like a lamb
 But I intend to leave like a lion It hit me like a slow bullet
 It hit me like a slow bullet
