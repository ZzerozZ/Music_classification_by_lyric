Rock|

                        Took me down to the river
 So I could drown, drown, drown
 Looking up trough the water
 I kept sinking down, down, down I feel like I'm dying
 I've got one foot in the ground
 Never knew what love was
 Until you came around You're going down
 You're going down, down
 You walk all over me
 You never thought I'd be
 The one who's laughing now
 Now that you're going down Take it down to the basement
 You look around, 'round, 'round
 And we sit there in silence
 I watch you go down, down, down I feel like I'm flying
 I've got my head in the clouds
 Never thought I was crazy
 Until you came around You're going down
 You're going down, down
 You walk all over me
 You never thought I'd be
 The one who's laughing now
 Now that you're going down You're going down, down
 You walk all over me
 You never thought I'd be
 The one who's laughing now
 Now that you're going down Took me down to the river
 So I could drown, drown, drown You're going down
 You're going down, down
 You walk all over me
 You never thought I'd be
 The one who's laughing now
 Now that you're going down
 (Down, down, down) You're going down, down
 (Down)
 You walk all over me
 You never thought I'd be
 The one who's laughing now
 Now that you're going down
