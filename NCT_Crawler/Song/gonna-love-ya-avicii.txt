                        Bài hát: Gonna Love Ya - Avicii 

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

Livin' up in California
Lovin' life but I've been waiting for ya
Turn my dreams and twist my fate
But God I hope it's not too late

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

Sometimes it's hard to have the upper hand
When every dream you've had is turning into sand
You need someone to make your day
But he took your breath and blew it away

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

I'm gonna love ya like he never could
Cause I know you deserve so good
