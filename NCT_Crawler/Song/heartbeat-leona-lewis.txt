                        Bài hát: Heartbeat - Leona Lewis

If I could have laid low,
I would be creeping round the streets,
Avoiding all the busy main roads,
And keep an ounce of dignity,
And if I could have stayed home,
I would have slept through everything,
Turn off my phone and breathe a silence,
Stay in the comfort zone of me,

Cause, nobody lies in their bed,
Nobody’s heart gets broken
Nobody cries in when they’re flying, going in

[CHORUS]
When I don’t speak,
Weak and hollow heartbeats,
Leaking through my heart seam,
Body sells me out, sells me out,
So I keep this deep and shallow heartbeat,
Under my control,
And you will never see me weak,
And you will never hear my heartbeat,
Never hear my heartbeat,
Never hear my heartbeat,
Never hear my heartbeat,
(Oooohhh) beat

If I never met you,
I would be busy with my life,
Going to work and still be happy,
I will be sleeping through the nights,
And if I could forget you,
I would go back and look for parts,
For patching up my broken heart,
And I would shut my aching eyes

Cause nobody shouts at their friends,
Nobody wants forgiveness,
Nobody doubts when they’re flying, givin’ in

[CHORUS]
When I don’t speak,
Weak and hollow heartbeats,
Leaking from my heart seam,
Body sells me out, sells me out,
So I keep this deep and shallow heartbeat,
Under my control,
And you will never see me weak,
And you will never hear my heartbeat,
Never hear my heartbeat,
Never hear my heartbeat,
Never hear my heartbeat, beat, beat

If I keep it down,
Just focus,
I’m invisible,
Cause when there is no sound,
I know where I belong,
I will be ok

[CHORUS]
When I don’t speak,
Weak and hollow heartbeats (heartbeats),
Leaking from my heart seam,
Body sells me out, sells me out (no, no, no),
So I keep this deep and shallow heatbeat,
Under my control (under my control),
And you will never see me weak, (noooo)
You will never hear my heartbeat (my heartbeat),
Never hear my heartbeat (never hear my heartbeat),
Never hear my heartbeat (heartbeat),
Never hear my heartbeat, beat, beat

Heartbeat, my heartbeat
                        
                    |
