                        Bài hát: Forrest Gump - Frank Ocean

I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on

My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump

I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff, and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest

Forrest Gump
Now my fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump

I saw ya game, Forrest
I was screamin' run 44
But you kept runnin' past the end zone
Oh where'd you go Forrest

Forrest Gump
And my fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy (yea)
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump

Forrest green
Forrest blues
I re-mem-ber you
If this is love, I know it's true
I won't For-get you (you)
(oh you you) it's for you Forrest
(oh you you) it's for you Forrest

Outro:
If this is love
I know it's true
I won't
For-get-you
