                        Bài hát: How Can I Tell Her (Early Version) - Lobo

She knows when I'm lonesome, she cries when I'm sad
She's up in the good times, she's down in the bad
Whenever I'm discouraged, she knows just what to do
But girl she doesn't know about you.

I can tell her my troubles, she makes them all seem right
I can make up excuses not to hold her at night
We can talk of tomorrow, I'll tell her things that I want to do
But girl how can I tell her about you

How can I tell her about you
Girl please tell me what to do
Everything seems right whenever I'm with you
So girl won't you tell me how to tell her about you.

How can I tell her I don't miss her whenever I'm away
How can I say it's you I think of every single night and day
But when is it easy telling someone we're through
But girl help me tell her about you.
