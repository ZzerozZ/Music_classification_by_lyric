                        Night and stars above that shine so bright
 The mystery of their fading light
 That shines upon our Caravan Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep
 Across the sands so I may keep
 The memory of our Caravan This is so exciting, you are so inviting
 Resting in my arms
 Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms You beside me here beneath the blue
 My dream of love is coming true
 Within our desert Caravan This is so exciting, you are so inviting
 Resting in my arms
 Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms Night and stars above that shine so bright
 The mystery of their fading light
 That shines upon our Caravan
 That shines upon our Caravan
 Oooh
