                        Song: Drag Me Down
Singer: The Boomtown Rats

Drag me down in colors pink and gold
(Like a ship that's going under..
Bring me home in rain and thunder)
Bless the night before the day grows old
(Like a ship that's going under...
Bring me home in rain and thunder)

Drag me down in colors pink and gold
(Like a ship that's going under...
I'll be home in rain and thunder)
Bless the night before the day grows old
(With pink and...With pink and gold)

It's just a moment of terror
A fraction of bliss
Your hearts in my mouth and
My soul's in your wrist
I love you I think
But is it always like this with you?

Tuck me up with stories I've been told
(Like a ship that's going under...
I'll be home in rain and thunder)
Then wake me up with days that come and go
(With pink and...With pink and...With pink and gold)

And when the record is over
The passion's been spent
The movie winds down and says "The End" in French
I tell all the lies
But do I have to pretend it's true?

I love you....oh, oh, oh, oh...
and...
I need you...oh, oh, oh, oh...

Drag me down, Drag me down, oh, oh, oh, oh...
Drag me down, Drag me down, oh, oh, oh, oh...
Drag me down in colors pink and gold.
