                        My brightest star's my inner light, let it guide me
 Experience and innocence bleed inside me
 Hallucinogens can open me or untie me
 I drift in inner space, free of time
 I find a higher state of grace in my mind
 I'm beautiful, I wasn't born to follow
 I live just for today, don't care about tomorrow
 What I've got in my head you can't buy, steal or borrow
 I believe in live and let live
 I believe you get what you give
 I've glimpsed, I have tasted fantastical places
 My soul's an oasis higher than the sun
 I'm higher than the sun
 I'm higher than the sun
                        
                    |
