                        Don't Walk Away

I've been, running,
In circles all day long.
I'm out, of breath,
But I'm still going strong.

I'm gonna get you yeah,
No matter what they say.
You think I'm losing,
But I always get my way.

HEY!

Don't walk away,
When I'm talking to you.
This ain't no time for
Bad attitude.
Don't gimme, that face,
When you know I'm really
Down for the chase,
Cuz my heart's already in it,
And I'm never gonna quit it,
When you finally gonna get it,
Don't walk away.

When I'm talking to you

You act, act like,
That I don't have a clue.
You think you know it all,
But I'm so onto you.

You think you figured out just how to win this game.
I'm on your tracks,
Yeah, I know every move you make.

HEY!

Don't walk away,
When I'm talking to you.
This ain't no time for your
Bad attitude.
Don't gimme, that face,
When you know I'm really
Down for the chase,
Cuz my heart's already in it,
And I'm never gonna quit it,
When you finally gonna get it,
Don't walk away.

I won't give up just like that,
I'm gonna make you mine.
If it takes everything I have-

Don't walk away,
When I'm talking to you.
This ain't no time for your
Bad attitude.
Don't gimme, that face,
When you know I'm really
Down for the chase,
Cuz my heart's already in it,
And I'm never gonna quit it,
When you finally gonna get it,
Don't walk away.

When I'm talking to you.

Yeah...

Don't gimme, that face,
When you know I'm really
Down for the chase,
Cuz my heart's already in it,
And I'm never gonna quit it,
When you finally gonna get it,
Don't walk away.
