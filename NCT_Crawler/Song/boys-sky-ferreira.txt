                        I knew it was love Boys, they're dime a dozen
 Boys they doin' nothing
 For me any longer
 Not be getting stronger Boys a lot of women love you
 But boys they just make me mad
 All the little things that you do
 Ain't gonna make me sad Then I saw one lookin'
 At me from afar Then I knew it was you all along
 I knew it was you all along
 Suddenly I knew there was love
 Then I knew it was you all along You put my faith back in boys
 Back in Boys I see you smilin'
 Boys'll never take the blame
 All the rotten things that you do
 Always getting in my way Then I saw one lookin'
 At me from afar Then I knew it was you all along
 I knew it was you all along
 Suddenly I knew there was love
 Then I knew it was you all along You put my faith back in boys
 Back in Cross my heart and hope to die
 Stick a needle in my eye
 Cross my heart and hope to die
 Stick a needle in my eye Cross my heart and hope to die
 Stick a needle in my eye
 Then I knew it was you all along
 I knew it was you along
 Suddenly I knew there was love You put my faith back in boys
 Back in
 Back in boys
 Back in
 Back in boys
 Back in You put my faith back in boys
 Back in
 Back in boys
 Back in
 Back in boys
 Back in boys
