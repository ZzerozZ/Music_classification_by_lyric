[Hook: Omarion]
If your chick come close to me
She ain't going home when she post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be
Ooh all my niggas close to me
And all them other niggas where they post to be
Ooh the hoes go for me
Have your chick send a pic like pose for me
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be

[Verse 1: Omarion]
Pull up to the club and it go up
Make your girl fall in love when I show up
It's not my fault she want to know me
She told me you was just a homie
She came down like she knew me
Gave it up like a groupie
And that's facts, no printer
Cold nigga turn the summer to the winter
She save me in her phone as bestie
But I had her screaming oooh
Yo girl wasn't supposed to text me
You want to know how I know what I know

[Hook: Omarion]
If your chick come close to me
She ain't going home when she post to be

I'm getting money like I'm post to be
Ooh all my niggas close to me
And all them other niggas where they post to be
Ooh the hoes go for me
Have your chick send a pic like pose for me
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Got your girl in my section finna blow up
Nigga smoking loud, I'm about to roll up
She ain't never got high like this with a guy like this
When she pop tell her hol' up
Better believe she gone leave with a real nigga
I dick her down can't put it down like I do
I get to bussin' no discussin', gotta deal with it
Team us, we ain't worried about you
Murder she wrote
When I hit it I'mma kill it I'mma get it like
Murder she wrote
You want to know how I know what I know

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
If your dude come close to me
He gon' want to ride off in a ghost with me (I'll make him do it)
I might let your boy chauffeur me
But he got to eat the booty like groceries
Gotta get rid of these hoes from me
I might have that nigga sailing his soul for me
Oooh, that's how it post to be
If he wants me to expose the freak
Oooh, that's how it post to be
Oooh, that's how it post to be
Oooh, that's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be
Oooh, that's how it post to be

[Hook: Omarion]

And all them other niggas where they post to be
Ooh the hoes go for me
Have your chick send a pic like pose for me
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be

[Outro: Chris Brown]
She 'bout to ride with me
And I don't even know her name
But I know that she your girl
She shows up and your mad and all
Bruh don't be mad about it, these chicks be for everybody
