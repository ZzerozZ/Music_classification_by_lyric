What a shame
We all became such fragile, broken things
A memory remains just a tiny spark
I give it all my oxygen
To let the flames begin
So let the flames begin
Oh, glory
Oh, glory
This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is what will be our glory
Somewhere weakness is our strength
And I'll die searching for it
I can't let myself regret such selfishness
My pain and all the trouble caused
No matter how long
I believe that there's hope
Buried beneath it all, and
Hiding beneath it all, and
Growing beneath it all, and...
This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we'll sing out
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what will be our glory
Reaching as I sink down into light
Reaching as I sink down into light

This is how we dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we'll sing out
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what will be our glory
                        
                    |
