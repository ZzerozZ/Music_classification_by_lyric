                        [Chorus:]
 I am the one in ten
 A number on a list
 I am the one in ten
 Even though I don't exist
 Nobody Knows me
 Even though I'm always there
 A statistic, a reminder
 Of a world that doesn't care

 My arms enfold the dole queue
 Malnutrition dulls my hair
 My eyes are black and lifeless
 With an underprivileged stare
 I'm the beggar on the corner
 Will no-one spare a dime?
 I'm the child that never learns to read
 'Cause no-one spared the time

 [Chorus:]

 I'm the murderer and the victim
 The licence with the gun
 I'm a sad and bruised old lady
 In an ally in a slum
 I'm a middle aged businessman
 With chronic heart disease
 I'm another teenaged suicide
 In a street that has no trees

 [Chorus:]

 I'm a starving third world mother
 A refugee without a home
 I'm a house wife hooked on Valium
 I'm a Pensioner alone
 I'm a cancer ridden spectre
 Covering the earth
 I'm another hungry baby
 I'm an accident of birth.

 [Chorus:]
                        
                    |
