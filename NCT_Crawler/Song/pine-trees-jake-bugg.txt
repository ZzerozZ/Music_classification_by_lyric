Rock|

                        You can walk in the pine trees
 You can sit down
 You can hold the earth in your hands You can run from all this
 You can go the long way
 You can carry my weight the whole way down As the crow flies straight
 Holds me in his gaze
 As he rises to his fate
 We can do the same I try not to visualize other people's eyes
 And their compromising ways
 And as I leave them far behind
 I try to hide the route of my escape You can sit in the pine trees
 You can feel at home
 You can breathe a sigh of silence in the woods
 You can bawl your heart out
 Make your feelings known
 Things the grass already knows As the crow flies straight
 Holds me in his gaze
 As he rises to his fate
 We can do the same I try not to visualize other people's eyes
 And their compromising ways
 And as I leave them far behind
 I try to hide the route of my escape
                        
                    |
