                        It's the things that you do
So physical
It's the things that you say
So flammable

You know I can't resist
Boy it's such a shame
Do you belong to another?
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But my heart just can't hold back

It's the way you make me feel
The way that you make me feel
Spinnin' my world around

Tell me, how can I walk away?
I don't care what they say
I'm loving you anyway
It's the way you make me feel

I'm goin' to make you mine
It's not impossible
Got to let you know
I'm irresistible

Baby can't you see?
You're the one for me
But you belong to another
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But my heart just can't hold back

It's the way you make me feel
The way that you make me feel
Spinnin' my world around

Tell me, how can I walk away?
I don't care what they say
I'm loving you anyway
It's the way you make me feel

Make me feel
Ooh, make me feel, make me feel

When I look into your eyes
Every time you smile at me
Oh, I go weak inside
Baby I just can't hide my love

It's the way you make me feel
The way that you make me feel
Spinnin' my world around

Tell me, how can I walk away?
I don't care what they say
I'm loving you anyway
It's the way you make me feel

Ooh, make me feel, make me feel
Tell me, how can I walk away?
I don't care what they say
I'm loving you anyway

It's the way you make me feel
                        
                    |
