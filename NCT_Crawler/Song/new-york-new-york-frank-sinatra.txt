                        Bài hát: New York, New York - Frank Sinatra

Yeah i know what you wanna hear, baby
And i think you're about to hear it now

Start spreading the news
I am leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York

These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

I want to wake up in a city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap

These little town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York

If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York

New York, New York
I want to wake up
in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill
A number one

These little town blues
Oh they're melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it
In old New York

And If I can make it there
I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York, New York
