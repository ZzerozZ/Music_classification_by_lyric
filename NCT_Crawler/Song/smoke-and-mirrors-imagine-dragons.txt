                        Bài hát: Smoke And Mirrors - Imagine Dragons

This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word; heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word; dream taker, life taker

All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word; heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
Disappear dream taker, life taker

All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
