                        Do you know, do you know 

Do you know what it feels like loving someone that’s in a rush to throw you away? 
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed? 

If birds flying south is a sign of changes 
At least you can predict this every year. 
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly 
I can't get it to speak 
Maybe finding all the things it took to save us 
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me 
Look in your eyes to see something about me 
I’m standing on the edge and I don’t know what else to give. 

Do you know what it feels like loving someone that’s in a rush to throw you away? 
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed? 

How can I love you 
How can I love you 
How can I love you... 

If you just don't talk to me, babe. 
I flow through my act 
The question is she needed 
And decide all the man I can ever be. 
Looking at the last 3 years like I did, 
I could never see us ending like this. 
Do you know 
Seeing your face no more on my pillow 
Is a scene that's never happened to me. 
Do you know 
But after this episode I don't see, you could never tell the next thing life could be 
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that’s in a rush to throw you away. 
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed. 
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that’s in a rush to throw you away. 
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed. 
Do you know, 
Do you know, Do you know....
