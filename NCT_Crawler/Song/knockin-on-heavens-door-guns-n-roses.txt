                        Mama take this badge from me
 I can't use it anymore
 It's getting dark too dark to see
 Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, yeah
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, yeah Woah, yeaha
 Woah, yeaha Mama put my guns in the ground
 I can't shoot them anymore
 That cold black cloud is comin' down
 Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, yeah
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, yeah "You just better start sniffin' your
 Own rank subjugation jack 'cause it's
 Just you against your tattered libido,
 The bank and the mortician, forever man
 And it wouldn't be luck if you could
 Get out of life alive" Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door,
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, yeah
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door,
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door,
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door,
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, woah, woah yeah Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door,
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, woah yeah
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door,
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, woah, oh yeah
