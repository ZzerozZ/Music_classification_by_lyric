                        Song: Lonely - Akon

Lonely I'm Mr Lonely,
I have nobody,
For my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody,
For my own
I'm so lonely,

Yo this one here goes out to all my players out there ya know got that one good girl who's always been there like
Know took all the bullshit then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave

I woke up in the middle of the night and I noticed my girl wasn't by my side, coulda sworn I was dreaming
For her I was feenin
So I had to take a little ride, back tracking over these few years, tryna figure out what I do to make it go bad
cause ever since my girl left me, my whole life came crashing

I'm so lonely (so lonely),
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Can't believe I had a girl like you and I just let you walk right outta my life
after all I put you through you still stuck
Around and stayed by my side, what really hurt me is I broke your heart, baby you were a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right cause without you in my life girl

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Been all about the world ain't never met a girl that can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run and I would be out chasing you
Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be, ain't no-one in the globe I'd rather see
then the girl of my dreams that made me
Be so happy but now so lonely

So lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Never thought that I'd be alone, I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone, so stop playing girl and
Come on home (come on home), baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out, I never wished I'd ever
Hurt my baby, and it's driving me crazy cuz
