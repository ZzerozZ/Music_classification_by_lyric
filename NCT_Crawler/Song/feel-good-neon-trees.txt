                        Bài hát: Feel Good - Neon Trees

[Verse 1]
I was born naked just like every other kid
I grew up scared to death
I'd never quite fit in
Then I met you, it was golden
I was drinking way too much
But what else is there to do when everything around you sucks
Come on, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands up, touch the sky
Everybody on your knees and testify
I was searching for the truth
I think they misunderstood
Yeah the truth is, honey, I just wanna feel good

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm tired of waking up alone
I just wanna feel good, feel, feel good
Stay, you and me, we can dance the night away
I wanna make you feel good, feel, feel good

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you were naked in my dream I had last night
Then things got wet and weird
And I woke up all paralyzed
I was shaken
I was nervous
Yeah, I'm way too old for this
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But it's us you're gonna miss
Come on, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands up, touch the sky
Everybody on your knees and testify
I was searching for the truth
I think they misunderstood
Yeah the truth is, honey, I just wanna feel good

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm tired of waking up alone
I just wanna feel good, feel, feel good
Stay, you and me, we can dance the night away
I wanna make you feel good, feel, feel good

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm anxious
A little depressed
Why do we make things so complicated?
Yeah, are you anxious?
A little depressed?
Let's feel good again, feel good again

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm tired of waking up alone
I just wanna feel good, feel, feel good
Stay, you and me, we can dance the night away
I wanna make you feel good, feel, feel good

[Pre-Chorus/Outro]
Hands up, touch the sky
Everybody on your knees and testify
I was searching for the truth
I think they misunderstood
Yeah the truth is, buddy, I just wanna feel good
                        
                    |
