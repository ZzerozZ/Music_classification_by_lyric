                        Bài hát: Sing Me To Sleep (Deficio Remix) - Alan Walker

Wait a second, let me catch my breath
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice
Anywhere, anytime
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath

Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Oh just sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep

Remember me now, time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby

Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep

A-anytime
I would do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Time away
Yesterday-day-day-day-day
A-anytime
I would do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Time away
Yesterday-day-day-day-day
