                        Sitting by a foggy window
 Staring at the pouring rain
 Falling down like lonely teardrops
 Memories of love in vain

 These cloudy days
 Make you want to cry
 It breaks your heart when someone leaves
 And you don't know why

 I can see that you've been hurting
 Baby I've been lonely too
 I've been out here lost and searching
 Looking for a girl like you

 Now I believe the sun is gonna shine
 Don't you be afraid to love again
 Put your hand in mine

 Baby,
 I would never make you cry
 I would never make you blue
 I would never let you down
 I would never be untrue

 I know a place
 Where we can go
 Where true love always stays
 There's no more stormy nights
 No more cloudy days

 I believe in second chances
 I believe in angels too
 I believe in new romances
 Baby I believe in you

 These cloudy days
 Are coming to an end
 And you don't have to be afraid to fall in love again

 Baby,
 I would never make you cry
 I would never make you blue
 I would never turn away
 I would never be untrue

 I know a place
 Where we can go
 Where true love always stays
 There's no more stormy nights
 No more cloudy days
                        
                    |
