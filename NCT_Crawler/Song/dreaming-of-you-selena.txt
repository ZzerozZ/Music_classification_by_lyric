                        Late at night when all the world is sleeping
 I stay up and think of you
 And I wish on a star
 That somewhere you are thinking of me too 'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
 'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
 And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
 Than here in my room, dreaming about you and me Wonder if you ever see me
 And I wonder if you know I'm there
 If you looked in my eyes
 Would you see what's inside? Would you even care? I just wanna hold you close
 But so far all I have are dreams of you
 So I wait for the day and the courage to say
 How much I love you, yes, I do I'll be dreaming of you tonight
 'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
 And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
 Than here in my room, dreaming about you and me Corazon
 (I can't stop dreaming of you)
 No puedo dejar de pensar en ti
 (I can't stop dreaming of you)
 Como te necesito
 (I can't stop dreaming of you)
 Mi amor, como te extraño Late at night when all the world is sleeping
 I stay up and think of you
 And I still can't believe that you came up to me
 And said, "I love you," I love you too Now I'm dreaming with you tonight
 'Til tomorrow and for all of my life
 And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
 Than here in my room, dreaming with you endlessly Dreaming with you tonight
 'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
 And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
 Than here in my room, dreaming with you endlessly
 (I'll be dreamin') Dreaming of you tonight
 (Endlessly)
 And I'll be holding you tight
 ('Till tomorrow)
 Dreaming with you tonight!
 (Endlessly)
 (Endlessly)
 (Endlessly)
 (Dreaming)
