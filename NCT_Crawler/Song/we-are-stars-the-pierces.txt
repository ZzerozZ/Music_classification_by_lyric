                        Bài hát: We Are Stars - The Pierces

We are stars,
Fashioned in the flesh and bone,
We are islands,
Excuses to remain alone,
We are moons,
Throw ourselves around each other,
We are oceans,
Being controlled by the pull of another.

And I just wanna be loved by you,
Yeah I just wanna be loved by you,
I see nothing worse than to sail this universe without you.

When we met,
I was pulling an angel out of a liar,
We forget,
Satisfaction kills our desire,
We are dreamers,
Wishing upon what we were born from,
We made plans,
Kill them ourselves,
And then we mourn them.

And I just wanna be loved by you,
Yeah I just wanna be loved by you,
I see nothing worse than to sail this universe without you.

And I just wanna be loved by you,
Yeah I just wanna be loved by you,
I see nothing worse than to sail this universe without you.
(I just wanna be loved by you)
I see nothing worse than to sail this universe without you.
(I just wanna be loved by you)
I see nothing worse than to sail this universe without you,
Without you.
