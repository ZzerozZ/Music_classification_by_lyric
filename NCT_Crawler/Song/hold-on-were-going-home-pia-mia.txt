                        Bài hát : Hold On We're Going Home - Pia Mia

[Verse 1]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you're good girl and you know it, good girl and you know it
You act so different around me, so different around me
Cause you're good girl and you know it, good girl and you know it
You act so different around me, so different

[Hook]
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

[Verse 2]
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you're good girl and you know it (you know), good girl and you know it (you know)
You act so different around me (so different), so different around me (so different)
Cause you're a good girl and you know it (you know), good girl and you know it (you know)
You act so different around me (so different), so different

[Hook]
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (I know it gets so hard)
Just hold on we're going home (we're going home)

[Outro]
Ohh, I guess that's just the motion
Ohh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
                        
                    |
