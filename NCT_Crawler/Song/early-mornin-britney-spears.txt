Early mornin’
alright now
I was out a little late last night
Got a little messy
Can’t be like that anymore
No...
[Chorus]
I was shaking my ass in the streets and moving
Just walked in and it’s early morning
Got drunk till the break of dawn
And it don’t stop till the early morning
Passed out on my couch and yawning
Just walked in, it was early morning
Got drunk till the break of dawn
And it don’t stop till the early morning

Met a tall dude, Kinda dark hair
When he walked up somebody grabbed him
But I liked him, told him “come here”
Kinda cool
Baby, we can make plans
Where ya live
Do ya mama live there?
We can hook up at the hotel
He was down
So I told him, let’s go
What happened next? Guess...
But, you don’t wanna know

Oh, I went out and I approached him
But we couldn’t get with his friends
There’s something ‘bout him moving slow
So I said “what the hell, let’s go”
Got up
Got on the dance floor
Hooked up with a guy named Joe
When the music was fast and slow
What happened next? Guess...
But, you don’t wanna know

Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let’s do it again
Let’s do it again

Yes, Early morning
Yes, Can’t keep doin’ this

I light your fire, Your one desire
Pull on me, baby and I’ll take you higher
You should try it, so come over here and let’s go so
Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let’s do it again
Let’s do it

Early mornin’
Early mornin’
