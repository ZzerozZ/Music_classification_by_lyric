                        I know I owe you a better time 
Then the way that I've been 
But something's messing with my mind 
And it's not giving in 

They say that I should want to be 
A man who leads us all 
But every time I look I see 
Another leader fall. 

So I'm gonna sit in a green field 
And fly a big red kite I'm gonna 
Send my mind up the string and I'm 
gonna get it right. 

They say that I should want to have 
A big bank account 
What Uncle Sam don't take from me 
Man I don't need to count. 

So I'm gonna sit in a green field 
And fly a big red kite I'm gonna 
Send my mind up the string and I'm 
gonna get it right. 

They say that I should want to stand 
For what I don't believe 
I'm sitting thinking to myself 
What kind of man could leave. 

So I'm gonna sit in a green field 
And fly a big red kite I'm gonna 
Send my mind up the string and I'm 
gonna get it right. 

So I'm gonna sit in a green field 
And fly a big red kite I'm gonna 
Send my mind up the string and I'm 
gonna get it right.
