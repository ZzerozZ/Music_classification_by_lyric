                        Bài hát: I Need You - M83

Have you ever had a feeling
That we're not alone?
Hold to call the feeling senile
They unearth more
Going down the dusty roads
We are cold and see-through

I need you

There's a reason after all
All the things that I have done
Pump the blood and leave it alone
Anywhere you take me

See it all
Just go and solve it all
                        
                    |
