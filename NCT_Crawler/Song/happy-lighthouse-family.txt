                        Hey, what's happened to our lives?
 When did you and me forget how to have a good time?
 You and I gotta get back to the life
 That we forgot 'cause we got too much on our minds Hey, we got to make some time
 For the stuff that you can't buy
 And get a life
 'Cause you know all that serious stuff ain't no fun Who says you can't be happy all the time?
 I know but I'm still gonna try Hey, let's all go out tonight
 Why don t you and me go out and have a good time?
 Make our life a supernatural high
 'Cause we're both leaving all that bad stuff far behind Hey, there's gonna come a time
 You kiss it all goodbye
 So get a life 'cause you ain't got a clue
 When that day's gonna come Who says you can't be happy all the time?
 I know but I'm still gonna try
 Who says you can't be happy all the time?
 Say what you like but I'm still gonna try Who says you can't be happy all the time?
 I know but I'm still gonna try
 Who says you can't be happy all the time?
 I know but I'm still gonna try Who says you can't be happy all the time?
 Say what you like but I'm still gonna try
 But I'm still gonna try, but I'm still gonna try
