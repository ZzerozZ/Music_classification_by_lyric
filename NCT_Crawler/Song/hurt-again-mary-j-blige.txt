                        Sometimes I really don't wanna have to speak my mind
 'Cause I really don't wanna tell you
 How I am digging you so, I can't let go
 But it hurts me to my soul To tell you every little thing that is on my mind
 I can't let you know so I hide it inside
 All my feelings for you don't want you to
 Let it go to your head I am mean to you sometimes
 But I can't get you off my mind
 So I hit you with the game
 Always tryna act like your loving doesn't faze me
 When the truth is that it amaze me I know it's a big lie
 'Cause you can see right through my eyes
 How much I wanna hold you, give you all my loving
 Baby boy, let me show you
 And I really wanna get to know you But I've been there and I've done that
 And I promised never to get hurt again
 (Never, no, no)
 Never again, never hurt again You drive me crazy but I promised myself
 Never to get hurt again
 Never again, never hurt again I can't never ever let you seeing me this way
 So I take all my feelings and I tuck them away
 Fronting like I don't want you to hold me tight
 So I act like I'm putting up a fight To get your attention and make you stay around longer
 So I tell you I don't like it
 'Cause I know that that would make you wanna hold me tighter
 I can't help myself, I really like ya But I've been there and I've done that
 And I promised never to get hurt again
 Never again, never hurt again You drive me crazy but I promised myself
 Never to get hurt again
 Never again, never hurt again But I've been there and I've done that
 And I promised never to get hurt again
 (No, no)
 Never again, never hurt again You drive me crazy but I promised myself
 Never to get hurt again
 Never again, never hurt again I don't deserve it, I can never get hurt again
 Never get hurt again, never
 I don't deserve it, I can never get hurt again
 Never get hurt again, never, oh
 And I've been there I've been there and I've done that
 And I promised never to get hurt again
 (Never)
 Never again, never hurt again
 (No, no) You drive me crazy but I promised myself
 Never to get hurt again
 (Never, no, no, no, no)
 Never again, never hurt again I've been there and I've done that
 And I promised never to get hurt again
 Never again
