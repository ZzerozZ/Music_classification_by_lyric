                        Tell myself that I was doing alright
 There's nothing left to do tonight
 I go crazy on you, crazy on you
 Lemme go crazy, crazy on you Can't you see what you do to me baby?
 You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
 I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
 You're truly the only one who can do this to me
 You just make me get so crazy I go schizo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic
 One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
 You make me crazy, the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sack
 We *** like 2 jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit 'Cuz the next day were right back at it in the same exact pattern
 What the *** is the matter with us, we can't figure out if its lust
 Or it's love is whats attracting us to each other
 They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother Which would explain why youre such a mother***ing bitch
 But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today
 But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
 Just 'cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby
 Because you stay with me, maybe, 'cuz you're as crazy as I am
 'Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
 But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
 Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators
 And dildos, you *** yourself so much, you barely feel those anymore
 You're only 24 but you're plenty more mature Sure than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
 Like theyre in middle school, still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin'
 You play your position, you never step out of line
 Even though I stay in your business, you've always kept out of mine I wonder what's on your mind sometimes
 They say love is blind
 Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
 You ain't see the sign Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
 Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love
 I go crazy on you, crazy on you
 Lemme go crazy, crazy on you You are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad
 The moral, the very fiber the whole substance to my rap
 You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
 If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me as much
 As I rely on you to inspire me like you do
 You provide me the lighter-fluid the fuel my fire
 You're my entire supply gas, the match, and igniter The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs
 To my table, if you were to break I'd fall on my face
 But I am always gonna make you feel I don't need you
 As much as I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage But you are essential to me, you are the air I breathe
 I believe if you ever leave me, I'd probably have no reason to be
 You are the Kim to my Marshall, you are the Slim to my Shady
 The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Haillie You are the word that I am looking for when I'm trying to describe
 How I feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind
 You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
 The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me You are like the root to my evil
 You let my devil come out me
 You let me beat the *** out you
 Before you beat the *** out me And no matter how much too much is never enough
 Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love
 I go crazy on you, crazy on you
 Lemme go crazy, crazy on you
