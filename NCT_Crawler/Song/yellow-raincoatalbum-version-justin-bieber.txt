                        Cause I put on my raincoat my yellow raincoat
 Baby it’s keeping me to dry
 I put on my raincoat, my yellow rain coat
 You’ll know exactly why
 When the wind blows and the sun goes away
 On a sandfall storming me dead, it’s a destroyer, this is for you
 And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my chest, it’s destroyer, it’s like is to ya
 Whenever do I ever do I ever want this to phase me
 Whenever do I ever do I want this thing to make me
 Cause the fame and the money and the girls drive you crazy
 And all the he said she said I’m thinking maybe (just put on my)...
 Cause I put on my raincoat my yellow raincoat baby it’s keeping me to dry
 I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat you’ll know exactly why

 As I look around I see, what I think can never change me
 All I gotta do...is stay me
 Let the rest do the work and I’m sure that I’ll be fine

 When the wind blows and the sun goes away on
 A sandfall storming me dead, it’s a destroyer, this is for you
 And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my chest, it’s destroyer, it’s like is to ya
 And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket slow, yeah...jacket slow, yeah
 Whenever do I ever do I ever want this to phase me
 Whenever do I ever do I want this thing to make me
 Cause the fame and the money and the girls drive you crazy
 And all the he said she said I’m thinking maybe... (just put on my)...

 Cause I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
 Baby it’s keeping me dry
 I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat you’ll know exactly why

 (Just put on my)
 Do-do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
 Do-do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
 Do-do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do (Just put on my)

 I put on my raincoat my yellow raincoat
 Baby it's keeping me dry
 I put on my raincoat, my yellow rain coat
 You’ll know exactly why (yeah)
