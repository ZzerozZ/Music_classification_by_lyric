Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Tonight I'm so alone 
This sorrow takes a hold 
Don't leave me here so cold 
Never want to be so cold 

Your touch used to be so kind 
Your touch used to give me life 
I've waited all this time, I've wasted so much time 

Don't leave me alone 
Cause I barely see at all 
Don't leave me alone, I'm 

[Chorus:]
falling in the black 
Slipping through the cracks 
Falling to the depths can I ever go back 

Dreaming of the way it used to be 
Can you hear me 
falling in the black 
Slipping through the cracks 
Falling to the depths can I ever go back 
Falling inside the black 
Falling inside falling inside the black 

You were my source of strength 
I've traded everything 
That I love for this one thing 
Stranded in the offering 
Don't leave me here like this 
Can't hear me scream from the abyss 
And now I wish for you my desire 

Don't leave me alone cause I barely see at all
                        
                    |
