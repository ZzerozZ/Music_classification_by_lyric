                        For you I was the flame
 Love is a losing game
 Five story fire as you came
 Love is losing game One I wished, I never played
 Oh, what a mess we made
 And now the final frame
 Love is a losing game Played out by the band
 Love is a losing hand
 More than I could stand
 Love is a losing hand Self-professed profound
 Till the chips were down
 Know you're a gambling man
 Love is a losing hand Though I battled blind
 Love is a fate resigned
 Memories mar my mind
 Love is a fate resigned Over futile odds
 And laughed at by the gods
 And now the final frame
 Love is a losing game
                        
                    |
