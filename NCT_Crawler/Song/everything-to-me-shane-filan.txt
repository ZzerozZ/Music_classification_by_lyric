                        Bài hát: Everything To Me - Shane Filan

If life is like a jigsaw 
Where would you start 
You think you got the picture 
Like it's written on your heart 
You lay out all the pieces 
One by one 
But if you stare at it too closely 
The answer never comes 

So I take a breath 
Cos I need time to figure this all out 
I got lost inside 
What I thought I need 
But I understand now 

Cause I don't need the sunlight shining on my face 
And I don't need perfection to have the perfect day 
I just want to see you happy a smile on your face 
Nothing else matters cos you're everything to me... to me... to me... 
You're everything to me 

Can you tell me where I'm going 
Tell me what comes next 
Cause I know that it's not over 
Haven't even started yet 
I just wanna get there 
But I hope it's not too late 
Cause the closer that I'm getting 
The more I feel the way 

Let's take a break 
Take our time 
To igure this all out 
I got lost inside 
What I thought I need 
But I understand now 

Cause I don't need the sunlight shining on my face 
And I don't need perfection to have the perfect day 
I just want to see you happy a smile on your face 
Nothing else matters cos you're everything to me 

All that I thought I want 
Is not what I really need 
You're right here in front of me 

No, I don't need the sunlight shining on my face 
And I don't need perfection to have the perfect day 
I just want to see you happy a smile on your face 
Nothing else matters 
No nothing else matters 

Cos I don't need the sunlight shining on my face 
And I don't need perfection to have the perfect day 
I just want to see you happy a smile on your face 
Nothing else matters 
No nothing else matters 

Yeah I don't need the sunlight shining on my face 
And I don't need perfection to have the perfect day 
I just want to see you happy a smile on your face 
Nothing else matters cos you're everything to me... to me... to me... 
You're everything to me
