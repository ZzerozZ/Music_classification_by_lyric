                        Bài hát: Everything's Alright (To The Moon OST) - Laura Shigihara

Short steps, deep breath 
Everything is alright 
Chin up, I can't 
Step into the spotlight 
She said, "I'm sad," 
Somehow without any words 
I just stood there 
Searching for an answer 

When this world is no more 
The moon is all we'll see 
I'll ask you to fly away with me 
Until the stars all fall down 
They empty from the sky 
But I don't mind 
If you're with me, then everything's alright 

Why do my words 
Always lose their meaning? 
What I feel, what I say 
There's such a rift between them 
He said, "I can't 
Really seem to read you." 
I just stood there 
Never know what I should do 

When this world is no more 
The moon is all we'll see 
I'll ask you to fly away with me 
Until the stars all fall down 
They empty from the sky 
But I don't mind 
If you're with me, then everything's alright 
If you're with me, then everything's alright
                        
                    |
