                        I just came back from a trip along the Milky Way
 I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
 I called on old dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
 He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me Now Santa is a busy man he has no time to play
 He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas Day
 You better write your letter now and mail it right away
 Because he's getting ready his reindeers and his sleigh You better watch out, you better not cry
 You better not pout, I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town He's making a list and checkin' it twice
 He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town He sees you when you're sleeping
 He knows when you're awake
 He knows if you've been bad or good
 So be good for goodness sake Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
 You better not pout, I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town Little tin horns, little toy drums
 Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
 Curly head dolls that cuddle and coo
 Elephants, boats and kiddie cars too Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town The kids in girl and boyland
 Will have a jubilee
 They're gonna build a toyland
 All around the Christmas tree So you better watch out, you better not cry
 You better not pout, I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town
