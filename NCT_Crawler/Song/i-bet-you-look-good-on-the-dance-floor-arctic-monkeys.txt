                        [Verse]
 Stop making the eyes at me,
 I'll stop making the eyes at you.
 And what it is that surprises me is that I don't really want you to
 And your shoulders are frozen (as cold as the night)
 And you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
 Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
 And I fuse the results in a bang baba bang-go

 [Chorus:]
 I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
 I don't know if you're looking for romance or
 Don't know what you're looking for
 Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
 Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
 From 1984!

 [Verse]
 I wish you'd stop ignoring me because you're sending me to despair,
 Without a sound yeah you're calling me and I don't think it's very fair
 That your shoulders are frozen (as cold as the night)
 Oh your an explosion (Your dynamite)
 Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
 And I fuse the results in a bang baba bang-go

 [Chorus:]
 I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
 I don't know if you're looking for romance or what
 I don't know what you're looking for
 I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
 Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
 From 1984!

 [Verse]
 Oh there is no love no, Montague's or Capulet's
 Just banging tunes in dj sets and
 Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness

 [Chorus:]
 Well I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
 I don't know if you're looking for romance or what
 I don't know what you're looking for
 I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
 Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
 From 1984!
