                        Well I've been here before
 Sat on the floor in a grey grey room
 Where I stay in all day
 I don't eat, but I play with this grey grey food

Desole, if someone is prayin' then I might break out,
 Desole, even if I scream I can't scream that loud

I'm all alone again
 Crawling back home again
 Stuck by the phone again

Well I've been here before
 Sat on a floor in a grey grey mood
 Where I stay up all night
 And all that I write is a grey grey tune

So pray for me child, just for a while
 That I might break out yeah
 Pray for me child
 Even a smile would do for now

'Cause I'm all alone again
 Crawling back home again
 Stuck by the phone again

Have I still got you to be my open door
 Have I still got you to be my sandy shore
 Have I still got you to cross my bridge in this storm
 Have I still got you to keep me warm

If I squeeze my grape then I drink my wine
 'Cause if I squeeze my grape and I drink my wine
 Oh, 'cause nothing is lost, it's just frozen in frost,
 And it's opening time, there's no-one in line

But I've still got me to be your open door,
 I've still got me to be your sandy shore
 I've still got me to cross your bridge in this storm
 And I've still got me to keep you warm

Warmer than warm, yeah
 Warmer than warm, yeah
 Warmer than warm, yeah
 Warmer than warm, yeah
