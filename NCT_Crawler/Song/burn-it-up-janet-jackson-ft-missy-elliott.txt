Whooo, I'ma shut this down 
Kitty kat, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow 
Hit it with the he, to the he to the how

Quick to brag nigga, know I been right here 
Lately I've been on, on a mission yeah

All it is is love in the booth 

When the DJ play this we gon' dance like no one's watching 
Hey Mr DJ, bump the track and won't you turn it up? 
I'ma dance all night and I don't care who's out there watching us 
Just give me that fire and 
I'm gonna show you how to burn it up 

Hurt your body, burn it up more 
Burn it up and burn it up more 
Hurt your body, burn it up more 
That's how I burn it up 

Ain't no sittin' down, gotta keep it up 
Me and Missy got the whole room jumpin' up (that's right) 
Instant motion from the second it drop 
We get ahead with the beat is so hot, hot 

So tell me what you wanna do? Louder 
But don't do nothin' stupid 
What is happening in front of you 
All it is is love in the booth 

When the DJ play this we gon' dance like no one's watching 
Hey Mr DJ bump the track and won't you turn it up 
I'ma dance all night and I don't care who's out there watching us 
Just give me that fire, I'ma show you how to burn it up [x2] 

Hurt your body, burn it up more 
Burn it up and burn it up more 
Hurt your body, burn it up more
