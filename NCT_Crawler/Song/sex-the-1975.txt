Rock|

                        And this is how it starts
 You take your shoes off in the back of my van
 My shirt looks so good
 When it's just hanging off your back
 And she said use your hands and my spare time
 We've got one thing in common it's this tongue of mine
 She said she's got a boyfriend anyway There's only minutes before I drop you off
 And all we seem to do it talk about sex
 She's got a boyfriend anyway
 She's got a boyfriend anyway
 I love your friend when I saw his film
 He's got a funny face but I like that because he still looks cool
 She's got a boyfriend anyway
 She's got a boyfriend anyway Now we are on the bed in my room
 And I'm about to fill his shoes
 But you say no
 But do you say no
 Does he take care of you
 Or could I easily fill his shoes
 Do you say no
 Do you say no And now we're just outside of town
 And you're making your way down
 She's got a boyfriend anyway
 She's got a boyfriend anyway
 And I'm not trying to stop you love
 But if we're gonna do anything we might as well just ***
 She's got a boyfriend anyway
 She's got a boyfriend anyway You've got your tongue pierced anyway
 You in your hightops anyway
 You in your skinny jeans anyway
 You and your fit friends anyway
 I'd take them all out any day
 They've all got back combs anyway
 You've all got boyfriends anyway
                        
                    |
