                        Song: Love And War - Tamar Braxton

Somebody said every day, was gon' be sunny skies,
Only Marvin Gaye and lingerie, I guess somebody lied
We started discussin' it to fightin' then "Don't touch me, please."
Then it's "Let's stop the madness, just come lay with me."
And truth be told I'm wavin' my flag before it goes bad yeah yeah
'Cause we made it this far on for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry to get to the other side, let's go 'cause we're gon' survive oh

We stay on the front lines
Yeah but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only in love and war

Sometimes you're my general, you quarterback all these plays
Sometimes you're my enemy and I'm throwin' grenades
We'll just be chillin' and laughin', I'm layin' on your chest
Don't know what happened 'cause things just went left
But here we go back down that road
That's just the way that it goes
'Cause we made it this far on for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry to get to the other side, as long as you're there I'll survive oh

We stay on the front lines
Yeah but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only in love and war

As long as we make up after every fight when it's over
You know I'm comin' home right there where I belong
I'm takin' off this armor oh-oh-oh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh

And we stay on the front lines
Yeah but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode baby
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only in love and war
Only in love and war
Only in love and war
