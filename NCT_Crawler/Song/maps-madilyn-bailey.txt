I miss the days to the sweet lie
I miss the conversation
I’m such a fool of song tonight
I’m changing all of the stations
I like to think through, we had it all
We drove 'em out to 'em better days
But I’m not running I’m super fun
Oh baby why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And instead of my having back
So I wonder where were you
All the worse you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following


I hear your voice at my sleeping night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause all the strangers come over me
Now I can’t get over you
No I just can’t get over you

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And instead of my having back
So I wonder where were you
All the worse you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
Oh oh
Oh oh

Oh I was there for you
Oh In you darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest nights

Oh I was there for you
Oh In you darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And instead of my having back
So I wonder where were you
All the worse you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
                        
                    |
