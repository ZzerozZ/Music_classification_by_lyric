                        Bài hát: Knowing Me, Knowing You - ABBA

No more carefree laughter 
Silence ever after 
Walking through an empty house 
Tears in my eyes 
Here is where the story ends 
This is goodbye 

Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha) 
There is nothing we can do 
Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha) 
We just have to face it 
This time we're through 
Breaking up is never easy, I know 
But I have to go 
Knowing me, knowing you 
It's the best I can do 

Memories, good days, bad days 
They'll be with me always 
In these old familiar rooms 
Children would play 
Now there's only emptiness 
Nothing to say 

Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha) 
There is nothing we can do 
Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha) 
We just have to face it 
This time we're through 
Breaking up is never easy, I know 
But I have to go 
Knowing me, knowing you 
It's the best I can do
                        
                    |
