                        Down the way where the nights are gay
 And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
 I took a trip on a sailing ship
 But when I reached Jamaica I made a stop But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
 Won't be back for many a day
 My heart is down, my head is turning around
 I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town Sounds of laughter everywhere
 And the dancing girls swinging to and fro
 I must declare my heart is there
 Though I've been from Maine to Mexico But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
 I won't be back for many a day
 My heart is down, my head is turning around
 I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town Down at the market you can hear
 Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
 Ackee rice, salt fish are nice
 And the rum is fine anytime of year But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
 Won't be back for many a day
 My heart is down, my head is turning around
 Had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
 Leave a little girl in Kingston town
 Leave a little girl in Kingston town
