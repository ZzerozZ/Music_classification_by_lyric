                        "Sick Of It"

If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it! 

When everything you do 
Don't seem to matter. 
You try but it's not use 
Your world is getting blacker. 

When every time you fail 
Has no answer. 
Every empty promise made 
His own reminder. 

No one can make this better 
Take control, it's now or never! 

Are you sick of it? 
Raise your hands, 
Get rid of it! 
While there's a fighting chance. 
Are you over it? 
Bored to death? 
Have you had enough regret? 
Take a stand, raise your hands... 

If you're sick of it! 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it! 
If you're sick of it! 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it! 

Every single day 
I chase my own tail 
Like the bad inside of me 
Has gotta get, gotta get, get away 

I'm running out of time 
For me to break this. 
I'm tired of feeling like 
I'm never gonna make it. 

No one can make this better 
Take control, it's now or never! 

Are you sick of it? 
Raise your hands, 
Get rid of it! 
While there's a fighting chance. 
Are you over it? 
Bored to death? 
Have you had enough regret? 
Take a stand, raise your hands... 

If you're sick of it! 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it! 
If you're sick of it! 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it! 

I'm tired of it 
I'm over it 
I'm bored to death 

Gotta face this 
I'm sick of it! 

Raise your hands 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it 
Raise your hands 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it 

Sick of it! 
Raise your hands, 
Get rid of it! 
While there's a fighting chance. 
Are you over it? 
Bored to death? 
Have you had enough regret? 
Take a stand, raise your hands... 

Are you sick of it? 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it! 

Get rid of it! 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it! 

Are you over it? 
Bored to death? 
Have you had enough regret? 
Take a stand, raise your hands... 

Are you sick of it? 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it 

Are you sick of it? 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it 

Are you sick of it? 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it 

If you're sick of it 
If you're sick 
If you're sick 
If you're sick of it
