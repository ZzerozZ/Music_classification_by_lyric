                        Bài hát: Hater - Korn

You can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying
I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me down

I'm good, I'm fine
This life's divine
No hate, no shame
No one to blame
You might despise
Your life with lies
I won't chastise
Even if you think you can

Bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying
I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me

Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me
Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me

I can't escape from the disdain
Your heart, your pain
Your drama is lame
Why can't you find
Some peace inside?
I won't chastise
Even when you think you can

Bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying
I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me

Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me
Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me

Hater [3x]
Hater [3x]

I'm good, I'm fine
This life's divine
No hate, no shame
No one to blame
Why can't you find
Some peace inside?

Hater [5x]

You can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying
I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me down

Hater [4x]
You won't ever bring me down
Hater [4x]
You won't ever bring me down
Hater [4x]
Cause I keep flying
I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me

Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me
Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me
Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me
Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me down
