R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        It makes it easier, easier to bear
 You won't regret it, no, no
 No, girl they don't forget it
 Love is their home
 Happiness yeah
 Sq-sq-sq-squeeze her (Sounds so soulful don't you agree)
 Don't tease her
 Never leave her I invented swag
 Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab, proof
 I guess I got my swagger back, truth
 New watch alert, Hublot's
 Or the big face Rollie I got two of those
 Arm out the window through the city I maneuver slow
 Cock back, snap back
 See my cut through the holes Damn Yeezy and Hov,
 Where the hell ya been?
 Niggas talkin' real reckless, stuntmen
 I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond 'em
 Now I'm bout to make them tuck they whole summer in
 They say I'm crazy, well, I'm 'bout to go dumb again
 They ain't see me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz
 Last week I was in my other other Benz
 Throw your diamonds up 'cause we in this bitch another 'gain Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
 I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
 Uh, live from the Mercer
 Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
 Flee in the G four fifty I might surface
 Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
 Uh, everything's for sale, I got five passports
 I'm never going to jail I made "Jesus Walks" I'm never going to hell
 Couture level flow, it's never going on sale
 Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
 Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
 I get it custom, you a customer
 You ain't 'customed to going through customs,
 You ain't been nowhere, huh?
 And all the ladies in the house, got 'em showing off
 I'm done, I hit ya up mana-na! Welcome to Havana
 Smoking Cubanos with Castro in cabanas
 Viva Mexico, Cubano
 Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
 Driving Benzes, with' no benefits
 Not bad huh? For some immigrants
 Build your fences, we diggin' tunnels
 Can't you see? We gettin' money up under you Can't you see the private jets flyin' over you?
 Maybach bumper sticker read "What would Hova do?"
 Jay is chillin', 'Ye is chillin'
 What more can I say? We killin' 'em
 Hold up, before we end this campaign
 As you can see, we done bodied the damn lames
 Lord, please let them accept the things they can't change
 And pray that all of their pain be champagne
