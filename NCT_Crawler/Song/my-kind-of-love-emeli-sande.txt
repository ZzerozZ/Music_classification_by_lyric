                        Bài hát: My Kind Of Love - Emeli Sande

I can't buy your love, don't even wanna try
Sometimes the truth won't make you happy
So I'm not gonna lie
But don't ever question that my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

I know I'm far from perfect
Nothing like your entourage
I can't grant you any wishes
I won't promise you the stars
But don't ever question that my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

'Cause when you given up
When no matter what you do, it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That's when you feel my kind of love

And when you're crying out
When you fall and then can't pick
You're heavy on the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around
That's when you feel my kind of love

You won't see me at the parties
I guess I'm just no fun
I won't be turning up the radio
Singing baby you're the one
But don't ever question that my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

I know sometimes I get angry and I'd say what I don't mean
I know I keep my heart protected, far away from my sleeve
But don't ever question that my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

'Cause when you given up
When no matter what you do, it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That's when you feel my kind of love

And when you're crying out
When you fall and then can't pick
You're heavy on the ground
When the friends you thought you had
Haven't stuck around
That's when you feel my kind of love

'Cause when you given up
When no matter what you do, it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That's when you feel my kind of love
                        
                    |
