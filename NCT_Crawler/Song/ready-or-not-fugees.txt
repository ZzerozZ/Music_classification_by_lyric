                        [Chorus:]
 Ready Or Not, Here I Come, You Can't Hide
 Gonna Find You and Take it Slowly
 Ready Or Not, Here I Come, You Can't Hide
 Gonna Find You and Make you want me.

 [Clef:]
 Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
 Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
 Jail bars ain't golden gates
 Those who fake, they break,
 When they meet their 400 pound mate
 If I could rule the world
 Everyone would have a gun in the ghetto of course
 When giddyupin' on their horse
 I Kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine
 I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
 But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
 Thinkin' 'bout the robbery that I did last week.
 Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
 I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
 Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
 My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist.
 I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends,
 A born again hooligan only to be king again.

 [Lauryn:]
 I play my enemies like a game of chess, where I rest,
 No stress
 If you don't smoke sess, lest.
 I must confess, my destiny's manifest
 In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless
 Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess,
 Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
 Bless you if you represent the Fu
 But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're Doo Doo
 Voo Doo,
 I can do what you do, easy, believe me
 Frontin' niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees
 So while you're imitating Al Capone
 I'll be Nina Simone
 And defacating on your microphone.

 [Chorus:]
 Ready Or Not, Here I Come, You Can't Hide
 Gonna Find You and Take it Slowly

 [Lauryn's interlude]

 You can't run away
 From these styles I got, oh baby, hey baby
 Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
 And anywhere you go
 My whole crew's gonna know
 You can't hide from the block, oh no.

 [Praz:]
 Ready or not, refugees takin' over
 The Buffalo soldier, dread-lock rhasta
 On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
 Crews run for cover, now they're under pushin' up flowers
 Superfly true lies, do or die,
 Toss me high - only puff la,
 With my crew from lock high
 I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
 Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay

 [Chorus (Lauryn) repeat 3X:]

 Ready Or Not, Here I Come, You Can't Hide
 Gonna Find You and Take it Slowly
 Ready Or Not, Here I Come, You Can't Hide
 Gonna Find You and Make You Want Me
                        
                    |
