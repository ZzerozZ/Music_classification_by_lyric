                        Bài hát: Start A Fire - John Legend

[Verse 1]
I don’t know why I keep moving my body
I don’t know if this is wrong or if it’s right
I don’t know if there’s a beat, or something’s taking over me
And I just know I’ll feel so good tonight

[Verse 2]
I don’t know what your name is but I like it
I’ve been thinking ‘bout some things I wanna try
I don’t know what you came to do, but I wanna do it with you
And I just know I’ll feel so good tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if we keep on dancing
Take our rhythm to new heights
Feel the heat of passion, baby
Light up the night

[Chorus]
We could start a fire
Come on, let it burn baby
We could start a fire
Let the tables turn baby
We could start a fire

[Bridge]
I just know I feel so good
Don’t you know I feel so good
I just know I feel so good
Tonight

[Verse 3]
I don’t care if this turns into a riot
Lets get reckless, tear this place down to the floor
Turn the music way up loud
Can’t nobody stop us now
I just know I feel so good tonight
I just know I feel so good tonight

[Chorus]
We could start a fire
Come on, let it burn baby
We could start a fire
Let the tables turn baby
We could start a fire

[Outro]
I just know I feel so good
Don’t you know I feel so good
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
Tonight
                        
                    |
