                        Bài hát: Sober II (Melodrama) - Lorde

You asked if I was feeling it
I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning
When I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home
But who am I?
Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses

We told you this was melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish is melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes)
(Cleaning up the champagne glasses)

And the terror, and the horror
When we wonder why we bother
Wow, whoa, wow
And the terror, and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother (whoa, whoa-oh)
All the glamour, and the trauma
And the *** melodrama (whoa, whoa-oh)
All the gunfights, and the limelights
And the holy sick divine nights (whoa)

They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kiss and kill each other (whoa)
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other (whoa)
(Talk about it)

We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
                        
                    |
