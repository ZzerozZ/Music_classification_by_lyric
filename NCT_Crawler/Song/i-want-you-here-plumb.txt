                        Bài hát: I Want You Here - Plumb

An ache
So deep
That I
Can hardly breathe
This pain
Can't be imagined
Will it ever heal?
Ooh ooh

Your hand
So small
Held a strand of my hair
So strong
All I could do
Was keep believing
Was that enough?
Is anyone there?

I wanna scream
Is this a dream?
How could this happen
Happen to me?
This isn't fair
This nightmare
This kind of torture
I just can't bear
I want you here
I want you here
Ooh ooh

I waited so long
For you to come
Then you were here
And now you're gone
I was not prepared
For you to leave me
Oh this is misery
Are you still there?

I wanna scream
Is this a dream?
How could this happen
Happen to me?
This isn't fair
This nightmare
This kind of torture
I just can't bear
I want you here
I want you here

God help me
God help me
God help me
Breathe

I wanna scream
Is this a dream?
How could this happen
Happen to me?
This isn't fair
This nightmare
This kind of torture
I just can't bear
I want you here
I want you here
I want you here
I want you here
Ooh ooh

An ache
So deep
That I
Can hardly breathe
                        
                    |
