 Talk to a nigga, talk with me
 You look like you could really give it to a nigga,
 From the way you talk and the way ya try to walk for me
 The way you really try to put it on a dawg
 Threw ya hips like ya never did before for me
 The way you break yo' back, and I break yo' neck,
 And the way you try to put it on the floor for me

 Lemme address y'all niggas one time,
 While I lock that down, and I hit'cha wit that (YOU GONE!)

 Be the nigga in the drop,
 Y'all niggas know every time I come through,
 This mother***er, where we always takin the ride
 (So let me do this bitch)
 Y'all niggas know when we come, we be makin it flop,
 The way we making it hot'll make a nigga want to stop
 Get money, then cash that check for me
 All my niggas just bust yo' tech for me
 Everybody from every hood bang yo' head,
 'til you break your mother***in head for me! [Chorus]
 Just let me give you real street ***,
 To rap in yo' *** with
 We clap yo' seat, we whyle this heat
 Keep bouncin up and down these streets
 So nod yo' head and

 Break yo' neck nigga!
 Bang yo' head until you start to
 Break yo' neck nigga!
 Break yo' neck nigga!
 Break yo' neck nigga!
 Break yo' neck! Come along now (Let's put it down nigga!)
 When I bounce back and you know I done caught my breath,
 Y'all niggas all know how we do,
 When the way we bang niggas in the head, and we do it to death
 (We fold 'em back whodi!) The fire boy, you know we baking a ounce
 I know you love the way we be giving you the music, making you bounce
 Now *** it up just a little for my niggas,
 Every time we come through niggas know that we did it for y'all (Uh-huh)
 And the way we do it for the people,
 Niggas know we always give it to y'all
 I said bounce (Come on!)
 In the day time or the night, when ya creepin along,
 Well just bang this *** up in the truck,
 While you break yo' neck, now mother***er try to figure my flow
 See the way we come right through (When we come right through!)
 We be always blowing the spot, again and again,
 And make a nigga really want to stop
 Better tell yo' crew, yo' peeps,
 All my niggas better put they troops on
 And gather up your soldiers nigga,
 You know you better keep yo' boots on
 All my niggas in the place (Hey yo!)
 Wave your hands high now, and the way we put it down,
 Make a nigga wonder what he really gonna try now
 What ya really want to do?
 Just place your bet, and put'cha money where ya mouth is (Ah-hoo)
 All my niggas in the street just break yo' neck and keep on boun-cin! [Chorus] Here we go, and you know every time Busta-Bus be holding the fort,

 And when get up in the club,
 Or how my niggas at the bar how we locking it up
 And we get a little (High!) And we get a little (Drunk!)
