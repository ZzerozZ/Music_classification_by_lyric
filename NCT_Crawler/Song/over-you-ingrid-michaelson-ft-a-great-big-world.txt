                        Bài hát: Over You - Ingrid Michaelson, A Great Big World

Over, I'm so over you
The way that you look
In a 3-piece suit

Over, I'm so over you
The way that you held me
Like nobody else would

Maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do
I'll get over you
Maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do
I'll get all over
You
You oh
Over you
You

Over, I'm so over you
The way that you laugh
Made everything that I do
Over, I'm so over you

The way that you said that you'd always be true
And maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do
I'll get over you
Maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do
I'll get all over
You
You
Over you
You
Over you

I'm falling around you
I'm falling around you
I'm falling around you
I'm falling around you
Oh

Maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do

I'm falling around you
Maybe if I tell myself enough, oh
Maybe if I tell myself enough
I'm falling around you
Maybe if I do
I'm falling around you
Maybe if I tell myself enough, I'm falling around you, oh
