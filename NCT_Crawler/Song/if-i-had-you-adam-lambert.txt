                        So I got my boots on, got the right 'mount of leather
And I'm doing me up with a black color liner
And I'm workin' my strut but I know it don't matter
All we need in this world is some love
There's a thin line 'tween the dark side and the light side baby tonight
It's a struggle gotta rumble trying to find it

But if I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
You y-y-y-y-you
You y-y-y-y-you
You y-y-y-y-you
If I had you.

From New York to LA getting high rock n' rollin
Get a room trash it up 'til it's ten in the morning
Girls in stripper heels, boys rolling in Maseratis
What they need in this world is some love
There's a thin line tween a wild time and a flat line baby tonight
It's a struggle, gotta rumble tryin' to find it

But if I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
You y-y-y-y-you
You y-y-y-y-you
You y-y-y-y-you
If I had

The flashing of the lights
It might feel so good
But I've got you stuck on my mind, yeah!
The fashion and the stage
It might get me high
But it don't mean a thing tonight

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you, the money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
You-y-y-y-y-you
You-y-y-y-y-you
You-y-y-y-y-you
If I had you

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you, then money, fame and fortune never could compete (never could compete with you)
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy (it'd be ecstasy with you)
Yeah, if I had you
You y-y-y-y-you
You y-y-y-y-you
You y-y-y-y-you
If I had you
