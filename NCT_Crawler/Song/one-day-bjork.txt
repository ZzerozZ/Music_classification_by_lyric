                        (Bjork Gudmundsdottir)
One day
It will happen
One day, one day
It will all come true
One day
When you're ready
One day, one day
When you're up to it
Bjork
The atmosphere
Will get lighter
And two suns ready
To shine just for you
I can feel it
One day
It will happen
One day, one day
It will all make sense
One day, one day
You will blossom
One day, one day
An aeroplane
Will curve gracefully
Around the volcano
With the eruption that never lets you down
I can feel it
And the beautifullness
Fireworks will burn
In the sky just for you
I can feel it
One day
One day
                        
                    |
