                        Bài hát: Stay Stay Stay - Taylor Swift

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you... stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said "ok, let's talk" and i said

[CHORUS]
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you for quite some
Time time time
You think that it's funny when I’m
Mad mad mad
But i think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I’d only dated self indulgent takers 
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I’m always laughing
And I love you because you have given me...no choice but to

[REPEAT CHORUS]
Stay stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

[REPEAT CHORUS]
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

[REPEAT CHORUS]
                        
                    |
