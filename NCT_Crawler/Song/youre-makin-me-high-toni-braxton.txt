                        I'll always think of you
 Inside of my private thoughts
 I can imagine you
 Touching my private parts
 With just the thought of you
 I can't help but touch myself
 That's why I want you so bad
 Just one night of
 Moonlight with you there beside me
 All night doin' it again and again
 You know I want you so bad
 Baby baby baby baby (baby baby baby baby) Oh I get so high
 When I'm around you baby
 I can touch the sky
 You make my temperature rise
 You're makin' me high
 Oh baby baby baby baby Can't get my mind off you
 I think I might be obsessed
 The very thought of you
 Makes me want to get undressed
 I want to be with you
 In spite of what my heart says
 I guess I want you too bad
 All I want is
 Moonlight with you there beside me
 All night doin' it again and again
 You know I want you so bad
 Baby baby baby (baby baby baby baby) Oh I get so high
 When I'm around you baby
 I can touch the sky
 You make my temperature rise
 You're makin' me high
 Oh (baby baby baby baby) I want to feel your heart and soul inside of me
 Let's make a deal you roll, I lick
 And we can go flying into ecstasy
 Oh darlin' you and me
 Light my fire
 Blow my flame
 Take me, take me, take me away Moonlight with you there beside me
 All night doin' it again and again
 You know I want you so bad
 Baby baby baby (baby baby baby baby) Oh I get so high
 When I'm around you baby
 I can touch the sky
 You make my temperature rise
 You're makin' me high
 Oh (baby baby baby baby)
 Oh I get so high
 When I'm around you baby
 I can touch the sky
 You make my temperature rise
 You're makin' me high
 Oh (baby baby baby baby)
