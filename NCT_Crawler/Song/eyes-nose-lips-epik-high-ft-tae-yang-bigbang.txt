You left me paralyzed
No cure. No rehab for me
Funny that you got the nerve to keep askin' me how I've been
You're the victor in this pageantry
But the only trophy you deserve catastrophe.
I'd rather we be dead to each other
No eulogies said for each other
No rest in peace's
The memory's got my chest in pieces
I'm prayin' that your eyes are the first to go
The way they looked when you smiled
The way they opened and closed
Then your nose
Every single breath against my neck
And then your lips
Every empty promise made and said.

Please fade
Fade to black
Please fade
Fade to black
But the nightmares come back.

Because your eyes, nose lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dyin'
You still got me cryin'
Because your eyes, nose lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dyin'
You still got me cryin'.

*** a promenade
Let's juggernaut down memory lane
Leave no thought alive
To the slaughterhouse I'm takin' my pain
It's time to sever my brain from my heart and soul
My knees are burnin' hot
But God is cold.

I've been told
One day you'll know, too much of heaven's a sin
After the show, it's only hell that it brings
So take it slow and let time heal everything
They say that time flies
But you keep breakin' its wings.

You'll never fade
Fade to black
Please fade
Fade to black
But the nightmares come back.
Eyes, Nose, Lips lyrics on ***

Because your eyes, nose lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dyin'
You still got me cryin'
Because your eyes, nose lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dyin'
You still got me cryin'.

You wish me well
You wish me well
I wish you hell.

I never wanna look into your eyes again
No, I never wanna hear you breathe again
Let me go
Let me go
Baby, tell me this is the end.

Because your eyes, nose lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dyin'
You still got me cryin'
Because your eyes, nose lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dyin'
You still got me cryin'.
