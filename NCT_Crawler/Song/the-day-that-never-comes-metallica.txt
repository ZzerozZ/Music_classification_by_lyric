Rock|

                        Born to push you around
 Better just stay down
 You pull away, he hits the flesh
 You hit the ground Mouths so full of lies
 Tend to black your eyes
 Just keep them closed
 Keep praying, just keep waiting Waiting for the one
 The day that never comes
 When you stand up and feel the warmth
 But the sunshine never comes, no
 No, the sunshine never comes Push you cross that line
 Just stay down this time
 Hiding yourself, crawling yourself
 You'll have your time God, I'll make them pay
 Take it back one day
 I'll end this day
 I'll splatter color on this gray Waiting for the one
 The day that never comes
 When you stand up and feel the warmth
 But the sunshine never comes Love is a four letter word
 And never spoken here
 Love is a four letter word
 Here in this prison I suffer this no longer
 I'll put it into this I swear
 This I swear the sun will shine
 This I swear, this I swear
 This I swear!
