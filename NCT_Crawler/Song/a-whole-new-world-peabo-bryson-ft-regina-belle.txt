                        "A Whole New World"

 Ooh
 I can show you the world
 Shining, shimmering, splendid
 Tell me, princess, now when did
 You last let your heart decide?

 I can open your eyes
 Take you wonder by wonder
 Over, sideways and under
 On a magic carpet ride

 A whole new world
 A new fantastic point of view
 No one to tell us no
 Or where to go
 Or say we're only dreaming

 A whole new world
 A dazzling place I never knew
 But now from way up here
 It's crystal clear
 That now I'm in a whole new world with you

 Unbelievable sights
 Indescribable feeling
 Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
 Through an endless diamond sky

 A whole new world
 (Don't you dare close your eyes)
 A hundred thousand things to see
 (Hold your breath - it gets better)
 I'm like a shooting star
 I've come so far
 I can't go back to where I used to be

 A whole new world
 With new horizons to pursue
 I'll chase them anywhere
 There's time to spare
 Let me share this whole new world with you

 And in my honest observation
 During this operation
 (Oh)
 Found a complication in your heart
 So long, 'cause now you've got
 Maybe just two weeks to live
 Is that the most the both of you can give?

 A whole new world
 (A whole new world)
 A new fantastic point of view
 No one to tell us no
 Or where to go
 Or say we're only dreaming

 A whole new world
 (Every turn a surprise)
 With new horizons to pursue
 (Every moment gets better)
 I'll chase them anywhere
 There's time to spare
 Anywhere
 There's time to spare
 Let me share this whole new world with you

 A whole new world
 (A whole new world)
 That's where we'll be
 (Where we will be)
 A thrilling chase
 A wondrous place
 For you and me.
