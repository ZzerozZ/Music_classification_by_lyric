                        If you want it then I've got it
 If you need it, baby, I'll feed it
 If you love it, come and rub it
 'Cause there's something

 If you wanna trip let me know
 Ain't got no time for no hoochie games
 Just jump out the pipes, don't feel no shame I love me some hoe's, you know I got these young girls
 Aiming for this fishing pole
 When I stick it to you, girl, you'll be happy
