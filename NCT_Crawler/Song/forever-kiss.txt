                        I gotta tell you what I'm feelin' inside, I could lie to myself, but it's true 
There's no denying when I look in your eyes, girl I'm out of my head over you 

I lived so long believin' all love is blind 
But everything about you is tellin' me this time 

Chorus: 
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind 
Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever 

I hear the echo of a promise I made 
When you're strong you can stand on your own 
But those words grow distant as I look at your face 
No, I don't wanna go it alone 

I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line 
But everything about you is tellin' me this time 

Chorus - Ya-ah! 

I see my future when I look in your eyes 
It took your love to make my heart come alive 

'Cause I lived my life believin' all love is blind 
But everything about you is tellin' me this time 

Chorus (repeat twice)
                        
                    |
