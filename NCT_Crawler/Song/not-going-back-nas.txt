                        What nigga! What bitch-ass niggaz
 What! Babe, babe, start the car
 Nasir, come on let's go, get in the car now, let's go
 Throw it out, let's go
 Aight, aight, aight, yeah, but I got 'em, but I got 'em, though This is crazy, why didn't you just throw it out of the car?
 This is so stupid, what are you doing? Why are we even out here?
 Why are we out here? What's going on? This is retarded, yo we gotta
 This is crazy, never again, you'd throw everything away, for what? Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me, 'Son do not look back
 Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax
 When people act schoolin' with facts, tell 'em
 At this point in my life I'm all about chillin' Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies
 And twist, homie's hermano just died I gotta let it ride
 That's what I got the public thinkin', my nigga
 Just 'cause I ain't in the hood don't mean *** my nigga I know who died before the body dropped
 I know the guns that were used how much money the shooter got
 'Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all
 The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time Is all we talk when we talk of New York y'all
 Who to call and who to stay away from
 Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe son
 Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up What cars and what trucks they drive in
 What towns they spend the most time in when they grindin'
 I found out most of them are cowards they hidin'
 Behind reputations that's sour, not going back The streets keep tryin' to say
 Come back around this way
 I've already gone that way
 I won't go back again
 I'm not goin' back The streets keep tryin' to say
 Come back around this way
 I've already gone that way
 I won't go back again
 I'm not goin' back First thing that happen when you make a little paper
 You think the Marriot is livin' in a skyscraper
 Till you come across some ever more flyer paper
 Realize that five-star 'tellies are even greater Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie ***
 Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzi's in it
 First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
 All those things you still ain't really doin' *** kid 'Cause in reality I'll earn my salary
 The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
 It kinda make me wanna hate bling it's a race thing
 How they sell blacks to bootleg *** infact Real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
 Whores charge niggaz with raping
 'Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
 Watch us make bets on race tracks smokin' cigars So they counter the laws to take what's ours
 'Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
 So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars
 Instead of goin' back I'm buying the projects But I'm not going back
 The hood's in me forever y'all but I'm not going back The streets keep tryin' to say
 Come back around this way
 I've already gone that way
 I won't go back again
 I'm not goin' back The streets keep tryin' to say
 Come back around this way
 I've already gone that way
 I won't go back again And of course y'all know what I'm not going back to
 Those no friends of mine and I'm not going back to
 Ten carat gold it shine and I'm never going back to
 Sony if they don't have dough to sign, not going back to
 Y'all know that I'm not going back to Those liars who would, not going back to
 Not help you if they could not going back to
 Coke on the stove in the hood, y'all should know that I'm not going back
 The hood's in me forever y'all, but I'm not going back The streets keep tryin' to say
 Come back around this way
 I've already gone that way
 I won't go back again
 I'm not goin' back The streets keep tryin' to say
 Come back around this way
 I've already gone that way
 I won't go back again
 I'm not goin' back
