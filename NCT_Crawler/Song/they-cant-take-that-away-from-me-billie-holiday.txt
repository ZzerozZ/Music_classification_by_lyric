Blues/Jazz|

                        The way you wear your hat
 The way you sip your tea
 The memory of all that
 No, no they can't take that away from me

 The way your smile just beams
 The way you sing off key
 The way you haunt my dreams
 No, no they can't take that away from me
 We may never, never meet again
 On the bumpy road to love
 Still I'll always, always keep the memory of
 The way you hold your knife
 The way we danced till three
 The way you changed my life
 No, no they can't take that away from me
 No, they can't take that away from me

 We may never, never meet again
 On that bumpy road to love
 Still I'll always, always keep the memory of
 The way you hold your knife
 The way we danced till three
 The way you change my life
 No, no they can't take that away from me
 No, they can't take that away from me
