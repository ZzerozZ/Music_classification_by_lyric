                        My young love said to me
 My mother won't mind
 And my father won't slight you
 For your lack of kind She stepped away from me
 And she moved through the fair
 And fondly I watched her
 Move here and move there And then she went onwards
 Just one star awake
 Like the swan in the evening
 Moves over the lake Last night she came to me
 My dead love came in
 So softly she came
 That her feet made no din And she laid her hand on me
 And this she did say
 It will not be long now
 And she moved through the fair
                        
                    |
