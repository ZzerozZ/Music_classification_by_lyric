                        I don't wanna live in heartache
 Don't bring me down again
 Stop doing my head in
 When will it end, when will it end

 Get ready it's show time
 Got nothing to lose but you
 And now I've made up my mind
 You know what to do, you know what to do

 Jump
 Why don't you just jump
 Now you're out on your own
 Only one way for you to go
 So jump
 Why don't you just jump
 Now you're out of time
 And you know what you can do

 Sick and tired of you hanging around
 Why don't you get it through your head
 When I say it's over
 It's over and dead, It's over and dead
 [gun shot]

 You say I'm looking so good
 Yeah I'm doing fine without you
 Ain't missing nothing
 Especially you, yeah you

 Jump
 Why don't you just jump
 Now you're out on your own
 Only one way for you to go
 So jump
 Why don't you just jump
 Now you're out of time
 And you know what you can do

 Ooo ooo you didn't think it possible
 I could ever live without your love
 But you lost it all
 Ha!

 You say you need me
 (Whatever, whatever I've heard it all before)
 Can't live without me
 (Whatever, whatever I've heard it all before)
 And you say you love me
 (Whatever, whatever I've heard it all before)
 Do anything for me
 (Whatever, whatever I've heard it all before)

 So jump
 Why don't you just jump
 Now you're out on your own
 Only one way for you to go
 So jump (jump, jump)
 Why (jump) don't you (jump) just jump
 (jump, jump, jump, jump)
 Now you're out of time
 And you know what you can do

 Well you can jump!
