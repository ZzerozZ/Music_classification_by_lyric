                        There I go
 Thinkin' of you again You don't know how sick you make me
 You make me ***in' sick to my stomach
 Every time I think you I puke
 You must just not know
 You may not think you do but you do
 Every time I think of you I puke I was gonna take the time to sit down
 And write you a little poem
 But off of the dome would probably be a little more
 More suitable for this type of song, woh I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I can think of
 Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
 So *** it, I'm a start right here, I'll just be briefer
 'Bout to rattle off some other reasons I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
 Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
 I go and get another one, now I got two
 Ooh! Now I'm sittin here, with your name on my skin
 I can't believe I went and did that stupid *** again
 My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim
 ***! If you only knew how much I hated you
 For every mother***in' thing you've ever put us through
 Then I wouldn't be standin' here cryin' over you
 Ooh! You don't know how sick you make me
 You make me ***in' sick to my stomach
 Every time I think of you I puke
 You must just not know
 You may not think you do but you do
 Every time I think of you I puke I was gonna take the time to sit down
 And write you a little letter
 But I thought a song would probably be a little better
 Instead of a letter, that you probably just shred up, yeah I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made stop
 And think of how much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink
 To a stupid piece of paper, I'd rather let you see
 How much I ***in' hate you in a freestyle You're a ***in' cokehead slut, I hope you ***in' die I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
 I hate your ***in' guts, you ***in' slut, I hope you die
 Die But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
 It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
 It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack
 Aack But what else can I do, I haven't got a clue
 Now I guess I just move on, I have no choice but to
 But every time I think of you now all I wanna do
 Is puke You don't know how sick you make me
 You make me ***in' sick to my stomach
 Every time I think of you I puke
 You must just not know
 You may not think you do but you do
 Every time I think of you, I puke *** it
 Fuckin' bitch
