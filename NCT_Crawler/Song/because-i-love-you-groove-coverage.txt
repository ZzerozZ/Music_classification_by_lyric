                        I got your letter from the postman
 Just the other day
 So I decided
 To write you this song Just to let you know
 Exactly the way I feel
 To let you know
 My love's for real Because I love you
 And I'll do anything
 I'll give you my heart
 My everything Because I love you
 I'll be right by your side
 To be alive
 To be your guy If you should feel
 That I don't really care
 And that you're starting to lose ground Just let me reassure you
 That you can count on me
 And that I will always be around Because I love you
 My heart's an open door
 So won't you please come on in Because I love you
 I'll be right by your side
 To be alive
 To be your guy
                        
                    |
