                        Do you hear what I hear?
 Do you hear what I hear?
 Do you see what I see?
 Do you see what I see? Said the night wind to the little lamb
 Do you see what I see?
 Way up in the sky little lamb
 Do you see what I see? A star, a star
 Dancing in the night
 With a tail as big as a kite
 With a tail as big as a kite Said the little lamb to the Shepard boy
 Do you hear what I hear?
 Ringing through the sky Shepard boy
 Do you hear what I hear? A song, a song
 High above the trees
 With a voice as big as the sea
 With a voice as big as the sea Do you hear what I hear?
 Do you hear what I hear?
 Do you see what I see?
 Do you see what I see? Said the Shepard boy to the mighty King
 Do you know what I know?
 In your palace all mighty King
 Do you know what I know? A child, a child
 Shivers in the cold
 Let us bring him silver and gold
 Let us bring him silver and gold Silver and gold, all mighty King, all mighty King, ah ah
 A child shivers in the cold
 Let us bring him silver and gold, silver and gold Said the King to the people everywhere
 Listen to what I say
 Pray for peace, people everywhere,
 Listen to what I say A child, a child
 Sleeping in the night
 He will bring us goodness and light
 He will bring us goodness and light Do you hear what I hear?
 Do you hear what I hear?
 Do you hear what I hear?
 Do you hear what I hear?
 Do you hear what I hear?
