                        One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small
 And the ones that mother gives you, don't do anything at all Go ask Alice, when she's ten feet tall And if you go chasing rabbits, and you know you're going to fall
 Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call And call Alice, when she was just small When the men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go
 And you've just had some kind of mushroom, and your mind is moving low Go ask Alice, I think she'll know When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead
 And the white knight is talking backwards
 And the red queen's off with her head
 Remember what the dormouse said
 Feed your head, feed your head
