                        Bài hát: Clarity - Zedd, Foxes 

High dive into frozen waves 
where the past comes back to life 
Fight fear for the selfish pain 
And it's worth it every time 
Hold still right before we crash 
Cause we both know how this ends 
our clock ticks till it breaks your glass 
And I drown in you again 

Cause you are the piece of me 
I wish I didn't need 
Chasing relentlessly 
Still fight and I don't know why 

If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy 
If our love's insanity why are you my clarity 

walk on through a red parade 
And refuse to make amends 
It cuts deep through our ground 
And makes us forget all common sense 
Don't speak as I try to leave 
Cause we both know what we'll choose 
If you pull, then I'll push too deep 
And I'll fall right back to you 

Cause you are the piece of me 
I wish I didn't need 
Chasing relentlessly 
Still fight and I don't know why 

If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy 
If our love's insanity why are you my clarity 

Why are you my remedy 
Why are you my remedy 

If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy 
If our love's insanity why are you my clarity
                        
                    |
