                        It's time to slow it down
 Steadily grinding
 And this is the big Doggy Dog Dog
 And I ain't talkin' about no Air Force Ones
 I just gotta know
 Before you let me get some Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?
 I've got to know
 Or you could show me
 Silk, cotton, see through lace, your sexy thong
 I've got to know
 Or you could show me Freak a leek, peep, peep
 Let a nigga sneak a few peek-a-boo
 Let's see what we can do
 About freakin' you
 An' sneaking you into a quiet place
 So I can look at it
 Face to face
 Let me guess
 You prefer to wear cotton
 I can tell 'Cause you like squattin'
 Your last dude
 He was so rotten
 And now your love is to be gotten
 Yeah, baby girl, I can read your mind
 But what I'm really tryin' to do
 Is read between your panty lines
 I know it seems, oh, so personal But I'm just trying to
 Make you feel real comfortable
 I know
 So, what will it be?
 And the type of underwear you wear
 I mean, is troubling me
 Can I get a glimpse?
 One for the pimps I've got one quesion
 Answer me this
 Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?
 I've got to know
 Or you could show me
 Silk, cotton, see through lace, your sexy thong
 I've got to know
 Or you could show me You came by the church
 With a whole lot of body
 Got invited to our annual pajama party
 Workin' that lace
 I think it was the first cut
 Yeah bitch, you got a big ol' butt
 Hiding it, should be dividing it
 It's real tight in there But I got a way to widen it
 Sliding it real smooth
 Like what a little bit of mouth aid
 Is to getcha in the mood like
 Zoom, boom hit that boom, boom
 Right just to getcha groove right
 I can make it happen
 But it can't happen if you ain't good at it When you gone, let a *** have a look at it
 Callin' all callers
 Yeah baby girl, you a star
 But it's on you if you wanna go real far
 Now let me get a glimpse
 One for the pimps
 Now I've got one question
 Answer me this Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?
 I've got to know
 Or you could show me
 Silk, cotton, see through lace, your sexy thong
 I've got to know
 Or you could show me
