                        Love is like the ocean, burning in devotion
When you go, go, go, oh no
Feel, my heart is burning when the night is turning
I will go, go, go, oh no

Baby, I will love you every night and day
Baby, I will kiss you but I have to say

No face, no name, no number
Your love is like his thunder
I'm dancing on a fire, burning in my heart

No face, no name, no number
Oh girl, I'm not a hunter
Your love is like desire, burning in my soul

No face, no name, no number
Oh, love is like a thunder
Oh, love is like the heaven, it's so hard to find

No face, no name, no number
Oh girl, I'm not a hunter
Your love is like a river, flowing in my mind

Feel, your dreams are flying, dreams are never dying
I don't go, go, go, oh no
Your eyes tells a story, baby oh, don't worry
When you go, go, go, oh no

Baby, 'cause I love you forever and today
Baby, I will kiss you but I have to say

No face, no name, no number
Your love is like his thunder
I'm dancing on a fire, burning in my heart

No face, no name, no number
Oh girl, I'm not a hunter
Your love is like desire, burning in my soul

No face, no name, no number
Oh, love is like a thunder
Oh, love is like the heaven, it's so hard to find

No face, no name, no number
Oh girl, I'm not a hunter
Your love is like a river, flowing in my mind

No, oh
No, oh
No, oh
No

No face, no name, no number
Your love is like his thunder
I'm dancing on a fire, burning in my heart

No face, no name, no number
Oh girl, I'm not a hunter
Your love is like desire, burning in my soul

No face, no name, no number
Oh, love is like a thunder
Oh, love is like the heaven, it's so hard to find

No face, no name, no number
Oh girl, I'm not a hunter
Your love is like a river, flowing in my mind
