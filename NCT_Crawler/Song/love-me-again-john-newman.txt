                        Bài hát: Love Me Again - John Newman 

Know I’ve done wrong 
I left your heart torn 
Is that what devils do? 
Took you so low 
Where only fools go 
I shook the angel in you 

Now I’m rising from the ground 
Rising up to you 
Filled with all the strength I found 
There's nothing I can’t do! 

[Chorus] 
I need to know now, know now 
Can you love me again? 
I need to know now, know now 
Can you love me again? 
I need to know now, know now 
Can you love me again? 
I need to know now, know now 
Can you love me again? 

Can you love me again? 

It’s unforgivable 
I stole and burnt your soul 
Is that what demons do? 
They rule the worst of me 
Destroy everything 
They bring down angels like you 

Now I’m rising from the ground 
Rising up to you 
Filled with all the strength I found 
There's nothing I can’t do! 

[Chorus:] 
I need to know now, know now 
Can you love me again? 
I need to know now, know now 
Can you love me again? 

Can you love me again? 

I told you once again 
Do this again, do this again oh lord 
I told you once again 
Do this again, do this again oh no 

[Chorus] 
I need to know now, know now 
Can you love me again? 
I need to know now, know now 
Can you love me again? 
I need to know now, know now 
Can you love me again? 
Oh no no 

Can you love me again?
                        
                    |
