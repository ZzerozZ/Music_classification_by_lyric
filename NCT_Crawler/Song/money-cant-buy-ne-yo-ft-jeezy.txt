                        You lookin' better than a Scarface starter kit
 All hundreds, small faces nothin' counterfeit
 You want this ghetto D? Or that over the counter ***?
 Catch you slippin' in the kitchen, on the counter *** (damn)
 Oh *** (sup), I guess I'll pause for these bitches
 Guess I'll ball for these niggas, swear this my last three swishers
 On my grown man *** I'm 'bout to kill this bitches Baby you know I got some money
 Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
 But when I look in your eyes
 Baby you got everything money just can't buy
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy) Diamond in the back, sunroof top
 Got a diamond on my lap and my sunroof off
 Her mind strong but her body so soft
 Tattoo on her hip read "Only for a Boss"
 She ain't impressed with the way I ball
 She said "You seen one ghost, you seen 'em all"
 Even though that thing cold
 She said "A Rolls Royce or a Civic, Daddy I'mma roll with you"
 She ride for me, die for me, love me, that's how she do
 I pulled up close and I tell her what's true Baby you know I got some money
 Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
 But when I look in your eyes
 Baby you got everything money just can't buy
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy) Shawty where you at? Meet me at the mall
 Told her "Let me buy you something", she replied "Naw"
 She said her love won't be bought
 I don't need to spend some no money, spend some time that's all
 I told her "Daddy don't mind spending"
 I want to see you shine like the diamonds in my pendant
 She told me she don't care for the flash
 Want affection not cash, girl I ain't even mad at you
 She ride for me, die for me, love me, that's how she do
 I pulled up close and I tell her what's true Baby you know I got some money
 Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
 But when I look in your eyes
 Baby you got everything money just can't buy
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy) What's happening with it baby? Hope you don't think that I'm crazy
 Say me and you, get us some practice makin' a baby
 I will take some out the stash and buy you that new Mercedes
 Then be all up in that ass in the back of that new Mercedes
 You call for the protectin', yeah, send me your issues
 They ain't 'bout to be playing with her, me and these pistols
 See that thirty-six for D'Usse, I'm the provider
 Come scoop me in that 458, you be the rider
 (Yeah) Oh well, that's that, back to the party
 Bet you niggas anything I'm leaving here with shawty
 Got a feeling that she fuckin' with me for me
 She got me feeling like I got a million on me Baby you know I got some money
 Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
 But when I look in your eyes
 Baby you got everything money just can't buy
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy)
 (All the things money can't buy)
