                        Bài hát: Malibu - Hole

Crash and burn
 All the stars explode tonight
 How'd you get so desperate?
 How'd you stay alive?
 Help me please
 Burn the sorrow from your eyes
 Oh come on, be alive again
 Don't lay down and die Hey hey, you know what to do
 Oh baby, drive away to Malibu Get well soon
 Please don't go any higher
 How are you so burned when you're barely on fire?
 Cry to the angels
 I'm gonna rescue you
 I'm gonna set you free tonight, baby
 Pour over me Hey hey, we're all watching you
 Oh baby, fly away to Malibu
 Cry to the angels
 That swallow you
 Go and part the sea, yeah, in Malibu And the sun goes down
 I watch you slip away
 And the sun goes down
 I walk into the waves
 And the sun goes down
 I watch you slip away
 And I walk And I knew, love would tear you apart
 Oh, and I knew the darkest secret of your heart Hey hey, I'm gonna follow you
 Oh baby, fly away, yeah, to Malibu
 Oceans of angels
 Oceans of stars
 Down by the sea is where you drown your scars I can't be near you
 The light just radiates
 I can't be near you
 The light just radiates
