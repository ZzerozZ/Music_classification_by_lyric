                        I love you. I love you.
 Is all that I can say.
 I love you. I love you.
 The same old worlds I'm saying in the same old way.

 I love you. I love you.
 Three words that are divine.
 And now, my dear, I'm waitin' to hear
 The words that will make you mine.

 Little girl, I love you.
 Can't you see I love you.
 I love you. Can't you see I love you.

 I love you. I love you.
 Three words that are divine.
 And now, my dear, I'm waitin' to hear
 The words that make you mine.
