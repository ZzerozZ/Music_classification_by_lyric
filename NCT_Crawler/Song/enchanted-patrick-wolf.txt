                        Enchanted, enchanted
 This magical place that we've found
 No one here but us and the sound
 Of the stars and the night owls
 Your breath and the rolling clouds
 Enchanted, I am, by you Now love has come to me
 And set apart thee
 From all of the maddening crowds
 The orchard is leaning her bows
 To hear our laughter
 And we roll in the order
 And enchanted, I am, by you Enchanted, I am, by you
                        
                    |
