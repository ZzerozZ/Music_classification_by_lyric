                        One 44, two 45's
 3 loaded clips, 4 niggas roll, one nigga drives
 500 benz, 6 reasons why
 This kid should die
 We shooting every mother***er outside
 Pulled on his block, jumped out the car, guns in our hand
 At the same time everybody ran
 There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
 Let the trigger blow, 7 shots now he lying on the ground
 Blood on the floor
 Then we shot some more
 Niggas he was with
 2 niggas hit, one nigga fell
 One tryed to run, go get him son
 Make sure he's done before we bail, I ain't trying to goto jail
 Must handle beef, code of the street
 Load up the heat, if these nigga think they could *** around
 Real niggas do real things
 By all means, niggas knowing how we get down, it goes Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what
 Kill kill kill, murder murder murder
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what
 Kill kill kill, murder murder murder
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what
 Kill kill kill, murder murder murder
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what
 Kill kill kill, murder murder murder Driving through roads, suburban chevrolet
 6 tinted windows, and I'm on my way
 To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
 Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
 Ringing the bell, where in the hell
 Could they be at, I'm about to leave
 Steppin' slow, where my truck was at
 Who the *** is that?
 Could it be a jack?
 Now pull my strap, it's my man
 And we have the same plan
 There them bitches go
 Civic '94, looking funny though
 Open up the car door, funny smile
 *** 2 already, 3rd ass was heavy
 "Nas this is sherri, sherri this is nas, and his man, ready?"
 Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
 Ran through them hoes
 Plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
 Can't find my man, heard a blam blam
 Now I'm wondering, "in this scam, do I even stand a chance?"
 He killed the hoes, took all they doe
 Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky
 Coming down the stairs
 Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
 Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
 My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
 "put your gun down, we can skip town"
 Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
 Lift off his chain
 Took his ***, emptied out close range Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what
 Kill kill kill, murder murder murder
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what
 Kill kill kill, murder murder murder
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what
 Kill kill kill, murder murder murder
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what
 Kill kill kill, murder murder murder
