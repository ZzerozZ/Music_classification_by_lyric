 Go shawty, we back up in this bitch again
 We party, harder than you can imagine
 You can run wit losers or run wit winners and win I feel attention when I walk in the club
 G-unit to the socks, bitches all on a thug
 Gimme a henny on the rocks and a bottle of bub
 I don't need security, this ol' nickel enough I came to ball wit ya'll, pop the bar and all
 So bitches call ya hoes and niggaz call ya dogs
 If you love ya wife keep her at home tonight
 She might neva come home again, nigga aight Teeth, neck, wrists all lights, my life's like
 Ridin' in Ca$hville, they runnin' all stop lights
 Homie is that real, I pray I keep livin'
 My Momma jus' hadda dream of seein' me in prison My Daddy's a dope fein' an' I don't really miss him
 Ain't seen him in 10 years an' a nigga still livin'
 Tha same ol' 2 step, we move to a rhythm

 It ain't a pair of handcuffs can hold me I'm ridin' in the ol' school listenin' to some oldies
 My goals keep shinin', them hoes keep cryin'
 The handle of my 45, outlined in diamonds
 Just left Ca$hville, 'bout to fly to Miami Hopin' yayo watchin' Eminem, perform at the Grammys
 The reason niggaz like Eric Benet probably can't stand me
 'Casue I know money will make Halle Berry come outa them panties
 Bitch Ya'll niggaz in trouble, they shoulda neva let me in I know you gonna let me shine an' get mine
 I know you gonna let me in wit this nine

 Don't be mad 'cuz we is and you ain't ballin'
 Gettin' money is my motto for you broke folks
 Can't spend ya whole life payin' on ya car notes It's alright if you still on the block boy
