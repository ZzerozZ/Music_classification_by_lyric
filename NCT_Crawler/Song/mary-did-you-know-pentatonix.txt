                        Bài hát: Mary, Did You Know? - Pentatonix

Mary, did you know 
that your baby boy will one day walk on water?

Mary, did you know 
that your baby boy will save our sons and daughters? 

Did you know, 
that your baby boy has come to make you new? 
This child that you've delivered, 
will soon deliver you.

Mary, did you know 
that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man? 

Mary, did you know 
your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?

Did you know, 
that your baby boy has walked where angels trod? 
When you kiss your little baby, 
you've kissed the face of God. 

The blind will see 
The deaf will hear 
The dead will live again. 
The lame will leap 
The dumb will speak 
The praises of The Lamb. 

Mary, did you know 
that your baby boy is Lord of all creation?

Mary, did you know 
that your baby boy will one day rule the nations? 

Did you know, 
that your baby boy is heaven's perfect lamb? 
This sleeping child you're holding, is the great I AM.
                        
                    |
