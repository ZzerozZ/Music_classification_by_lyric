                        I asked her to stay
But she wouldn't listen 
She left before I had the change to say (Oh ~)
The words would mend
The things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking Why does thing happen to me
Why does every moment have to be so hard

Hard to believe that:

It's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
It may not make it through the night
I won't go home Without U

The taste of her breath
I'll never get over
The noises that she made kept me awake (Oh~)
The weight of things
That remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us everyday

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking Why does thing happen to me
Why does every moment have to be so hard

Hard to believe that:

It's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
It may not make it through the night
I won't go home Without U (x2)

Of all the things
I felt but never really shown
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let U go
I should not ever let U go (Oh ~)

It's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
It may not make it through the night
I won't go home Without U (x2)

I won't go home Without U (x3)
