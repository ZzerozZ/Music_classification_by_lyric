                        Bài hát: Worse Things Than Love - Timeflies, Natalie La Rose 

[Timeflies] 
You look good, so fine 
Come on, put your body on mine 
Whoa, whoa 
So bad and you know 
You turn heads as you go 
Whoa, whoa 

Whenever we get together it's like (Hell yeah) 
I'm feeling fresher than the Fresh Prince of (Bel-Air) 
And, girl, if it ain't about you then I (don't care) 
No, I don't care 
And you know that you should 

Take a chance with me tonight 
I know you feel it, so do I 
Girl, you got to know there are worse things 
There's worse things than love 
Lonely hearts can multiply 
A world away from paradise 
Girl, you got to know there are worse things 
There's worse things than love 

And all the people say 
And everybody say 
There's worse things, worse things than love 

Them jeans, so tight 
I wanna peel 'em off of your thighs 
Whoa (they got me saying), whoa 
She a freak, that's right 
And we don't leave the sheets the whole night 
Whoa (you got me saying), whoa 

Everybody say 
And everybody say 
There's worse things, worse things than love 
Yeah 
Yeah, come on (Timeflies) 
There's worse things, there's worse things than love (Natalie La Rose) 

[Natalie La Rose] 
Better off alone, well, what do we know? 
We got a past that follows us wherever we go 
If we ever find a way to check our own egos 
We sit and talk with a couple bottles of the vino 
Maybe say tonight when it's light, cappuccino 
Maybe if it's right, I can buy a pair of stilettos 
Maybe that'd be ***, we can go and see tho 
Well all you need is love, boy, just go and ask the Beatles 

Take a chance with me tonight 
I know you feel it, so do I 
Girl, you got to know there are worse things 
There's worse things than love 
Lonely hearts can multiply 
A world away from paradise 
Girl, you got to know there are worse things 
There's worse things than love 

You know 
You got to know there's worse things 
There's worse things than love 
You know that people say 
You got to know, you got to know there's worse things 
There's worse things than love
