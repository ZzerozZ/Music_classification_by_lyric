[al:Grey's Anatomy Vol. 3 OST]

Breathe in, breathe out
Tell me all of your doubts
And everybody bleeds this way
just the same
Move on and break down
If everyone goes away
I will stay
We push and pull
And I fall down sometimes
And I'm not letting go
You hold the other line
Cause there is a light
in your eyes,
in your eyes
Hold on, hold tight
If I'm out of your sight
And everything keeps moving on
moving on
Make it through another night
In every day there comes a song
with the dawn
There is a light
Breathe in and breathe out
Look left, look right
To the moon and the night
Everything under the stars
is in your arms
