                        I travel
 All around the city
 Go in and out of
 Locomotives
 All alone There's no one here
 And people everywhere Crying 'cause I need you
 Crying I can feel you
 Crying 'cause I need you
 Crying 'cause I care It's a hot day
 And I'm dressed lightly
 I move carefully
 Through the crowd Here everyone
 Is so vulnerable
 And I'm aswell There's no one here
 And people everywhere Crying 'cause I need you
 Crying I can feel you
 Crying 'cause I need you
 Crying 'cause I care Only if a ship would sail in
 Or just somebody came
 And knocked at my door
 Or just (or just) something Crying 'cause I need you
 Crying I can feel you
 Crying 'cause I need you
 Crying 'cause I care
