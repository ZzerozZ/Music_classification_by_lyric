                        There's talk on the street; it sounds so familiar 
Great expectations, everybody's watching you 
People you meet, they all seem to know you 
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new 

Johnny come lately, the new kid in town 
Everybody loves you, so don't let them down 

You look in her eyes; the music begins to play 
Hopeless romantics, here we go again 
But after awhile, you're lookin' the other way 
It's those restless hearts that never mend 

Johnny come lately, the new kid in town 
Will she still love you when you're not around? 
There's so many things you should have told her, 
but night after night you're willing to hold her, 
Just hold her, tears on your shoulder 

There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you, 
that it doesn't really matter 
which side you're on. 
You're walking away and they're talking behind you 
They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along 
Where you been lately? There's a new kid in town 
Everybody loves him, don't they? 
Now he's holding her, and you're still around 
Oh, my, my 
There's a new kid in town 
just another new kid in town 
Ooh, hoo 
Everybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town, 
Ooh, hoo 
Everybody's walking like the new kid in town, 
Ooh, hoo 
There's a new kid in town 
I don't want to hear it 
There's a new kid in town 
I don't want to hear it 
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town 
People started walking
There's a new kid in town 
There's a new kid in town
                        
                    |
