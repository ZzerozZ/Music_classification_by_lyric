                        Yo, yo, yo check this out
 Yo, yo we gon go back to the old school right now
 Yo, yo Red
 Yo, what's up G?
 Yo, yo, yo check this out I believe there's no nigga out there
 As funky as you
 True so, what we're gonna do
 Is we're gonna go back to the old P Funkadelic get the *** outta here, word?
 Remember that old cut you did? Yeah, yeah
 That ol' P funk cut?
 Yeah, make my funk the P funk Yeah, yeah, that's it
 Well, what we gonna do is we gonna reminisce on that ol' ***
 Word? We gon go right back to the old school, but before we do
 I wanna know is my niggaz in the house? Hell yeah, I said is my mother***in' niggaz in the house?
 Hell yeah, So everybody just light your spliffs up
 Yeah, get your skunk weed and light that *** up
 And let the funk be your guiding light You heard it comin' from the lungs
 Of the funkadelic brother himself
 More funk than a bag of skunk
 Twice the funk that James Brown's socks
 Hit me, hittin' you straight across your notch
 Wit a tune yo, Redman, drop it Make my funk, the P funk
 I wants to get funked up Make my funk the P funk, we thump
 Lyrics that bounce the brain, make emcees jump
 Sky high can't touch the level so why try?
 Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy Rough and rugged and brother it takes ten to conquer
 That's why I'm on probation
 Ever since three, I cut throats of emcees
 Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees Of two-ten not from an oven, but mac ten
 A mac twenty maybe if I didn't subtract ten
 My background straight from a black mans culture
 Want more, buy the video or Redman sculpture For your mantle, damn you too hard to handle
 E Double slam once and Redman slam two
 Break hooks, earthquake shook the state of NJ
 Okay, bust the big gate For microphones that have swollen mic cords
 PE fights for power, Redman fights for soul power
 Funk is strong as a tree trunk
 Ask me the flavor make mines the P funk Make my funk, the P funk
 I wants to get funked up
 Make my funk, the P funk
 I wants to get funked up I'm back with the funk, chump
 You want funk, how many lumps?
 I got spunk I'm well known like Donald Trump
 I'm not
