                        Yeah, yeah
 On the track
 Go You know very well who you are
 You're the only one, you've got my heart
 And you've had a few, boy one too many
 But I'm the only one to wake you up (It was all a dream) I reminisced the way we kissed
 It felt so personal
 You took the chance to get my love and now you know (It was all a dream) That I don't need no one baby
 With out you I'm incomplete
 My love is just like the bar
 Put it all on me I don't want nobody else
 Baby all I need is you
 (You're the one I want)
 And I don't want nobody else
 Baby all I need is you
 (You're the one I want) You know very well, you're a star
 Cause I don't go that far, look where we are
 And ain't none like you, one in a million
 But I'm the only one to count you ooh (It was all a dream) I reminisced the way we kissed
 It felt so personal
 You took the chance to get my love and now you know (It was all a dream) That I don't need no one baby (I don't need no one)
 With out you I'm incomplete (incomplete)
 My love is just like the bar
 Put it all on me (put it all on me yeah) I don't want nobody else
 Baby all I need is you
 (You're the one I want)
 And I don't want nobody else
 Baby all I need is you
 (You're the one I want) I reminisced the way we kissed
 It felt so personal
 You took the chance to get my love and now you know That I don't need no one baby (no baby)
 With out you I'm incomplete (incomplete)
 My love is just like the bar (like a bar)
