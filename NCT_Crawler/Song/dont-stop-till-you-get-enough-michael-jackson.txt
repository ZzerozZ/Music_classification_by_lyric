                        Bài hát: Don't stop till You get enough - Michael Jackson

[Verse 1]
Lovely is the feeling now
Fever, temperatures rising now
Power is the force the vow
That makes it happen, it asks no questions why
So get closer
To my body now
Just love me
Till you don't know how

[Chorus]
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

[Verse 2]
Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain’t nothing like a love desire
I'm melting (I'm melting)
Like hot candle wax sensation
Lovely where we're at
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complaining
Cause this is love power

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Heartbreak enemy despise
Eternal
Love shines in my eyes
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complaining
Cause your love is alright, alright

[Chorus] x2

[Refrain]
Lovely is the feeling now I won't be complaining
The force is love power

[Chorus] x2
                        
                    |
