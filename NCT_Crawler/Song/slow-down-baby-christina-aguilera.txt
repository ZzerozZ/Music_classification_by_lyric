Slow down baby

Stop
Slow down baby

Whoa yeah (Slow down baby)
Oooh (Slow down baby)
Hey (Slow down baby)
Whoa ooh (Stop. Slow down baby)

I can tell that you’re into me, uh
Baby it’s so plain to see
I can see it in your eyes
You’re paralysed
Every time I pass you by

You’re the kind that gets your way, uh
Every minute, every single day
I can see it all in your face
You’re blown away
Coz I don’t want you in my space

You’re struttin’ ‘round here like you think that I can’t do without you
You got some nerve to think that I would give up everything

Slow down baby
And don’t act crazy
Cause you know you can look all you want but you just can’t touch? (Just can’t touch no)
So slow down baby (Hey)
I’m not your lady (Lady)
Boy you’re never gonna get it from me coz I’m with someone

Slow it down
Slow it down
Oh ooh whoa
Slow it
Slow it

Stop
Slow down baby

After all of the games you played
How’s it feel to finally get a taste?
You can dish it out but can you take the bed you’ve made?
Boy and its gonna change

I’m not falling for your stupid lines
I know you’ve dished them ‘bout thousand times
Saying nothing but a nursery rhyme
But I won’t buy it
Baby don’t you even try

You comin’ ‘round here like you think that everything’s about you
If you knew anything, you’d realise I’m wearing a ring

Slow down baby (Slow down)
And don’t act crazy (Crazy hey)
Cause you know you can look all you want but you just can’t touch? (You just can’t touch no)
So slow down baby (Slow down)
I’m not your lady (Your lady)
Boy you’re never gonna get it from me coz I’m with someone (With someone yay)

Do you really wanna waste your time?
Don’t you have better things to do with life?
Hey ey yeah
Whoa
Listen I don’t wanna get you down
But I ain’t never gonna mess around
So how many ways do I have to say...
Oooh ooh oh

Slow down baby (Slow it down, yeah, yeah)
And don’t act crazy
Cause you know you can look all you want but you just can’t touch? (You know that you can’t touch no oooh whoa)
So slow down baby (Slow down baby)
I’m not your lady (Not your lady)
Boy you’re never gonna get it from me coz I’m with someone (Oooh whoa)
You better stop
Slow down baby

So slow down baby (Slow down baby)
And don’t act crazy (And don’t act crazy)
Don’t you know you can look all you want but you just can’t touch? (You just can’t touch no)
