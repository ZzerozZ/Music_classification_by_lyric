                        Your neighbors were screaming
 I don't have a key for downstairs
 So I punched all the buzzers hoping he would be there
 And now my head's hurting
 You say I always get my own way
 But you were in the shower when I got there
 And I don' wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say You were so beautiful before today
 And then I heard what you say'man that was ugly The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
 Put it in the box, put it in the box
 Frank's in there and I don't care
 Put it in the box, put it in the box
 Just take it
 Take the box Take the box I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
 I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me
 Feel so *** angry; don't want to be reminded of you
 But when I left my *** in your kitchen
 I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense
 I just don't know you
 But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye'
 I think I love you The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
 Put it in the box, put it in the box
 Frank's in there and I don't care
 Put it in the box, put it in the box
 Now take it
 Take the box
 Just take it, take it
 Take the box
 And now just take the box
 Take the box Take the box
