                        Now you've got something to die for,
 Now you've got something to die for.
 Infidel, Imperial.
 Lust for blood, a blind crusade,
 Apocalyptic, we count the days.

 Bombs to set the people free, blood to feed the dollar tree,
 Flags for coffins on the screen, oil for the machine.
 Army of liberation, gunpoint indoctrination,
 The fires of sedition,
 Fulfill the prophecy.
 Now you've got something to die for,
 Now you've got something to die for.
 Send the children to the fire, sons and daugthers stack the pyre,
 Stoke the flame of the empire, live to lie another day,
 Face of hypocrisy, raping the democracy,
 Apocalyptic, we count the days.

 We'll never get out of this hole, until we've dug our own grave,
 And drag the rest down with us, the burning home of the brave,
 Burn.
 Now you've got something to die for,
 Now you've got something to die for.
