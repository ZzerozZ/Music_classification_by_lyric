                        People get ready, there's a train a comin'
 You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
 All you need is faith, to hear the diesels hummin'
 Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord So people get ready, for the train to Jordan
 Picking up passengers coast to coast
 Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
 There's hope for all, among those loved the most There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
 Whom would hurt all mankind, just to save his own, believe me now
 Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
 For there is no hiding place, against the kingdom's throne So people get ready there's a train a comin'
 You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
 All you need is faith, to hear the diesels hummin'
 Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord
