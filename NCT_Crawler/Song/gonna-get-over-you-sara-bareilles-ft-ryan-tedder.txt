                        Bài hát: Gonna Get Over You - Sara Bareilles, Ryan Tedder

Goodbye
 Should be sayin' that to you by now, shouldn't I?
 Layin' down the law that I live by
 Oh, maybe next time I've got a thick tongue
 Brimming with the words that go unsung
 I simmer, then I burn for someone
 The wrong one I tell myself to let the story end, oh
 My heart will rest in someone else's hand
 My why-not-me philosophy began
 And I say [Chorus]
 Oh, how am I gonna get over you?
 I'll be alright, just not tonight
 Someday, hey oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
 I'll be alright, just not tonight
 Someday "Maybe" it's a vicious little word that can slay me
 Keep me when I'm hurting and make me
 Hang from your hands Well, no more (no more)
 I won't beg to buy a shot at your back door
 If I make it at the thought of you, what for? (what for?)
 It's not me anymore And I'm not the girl that I intend to be
 I dare you, darling, just you wait and see
 But this time not for you but just for me
 And I say [Chorus] Say it's comin' soon,
 Someday without you
 All I can do, is get me past the ghost of you
 Wave goodbye to me
 I won't say I'm sorry
 I'll be alright, once I find the other side of
 Someday
 Oh, oh
 Whoa, oh
 Oh
 Oh, oh
 Whoa, oh
 Whoa, oh
 Whoa, oh [Chorus]
                        
                    |
