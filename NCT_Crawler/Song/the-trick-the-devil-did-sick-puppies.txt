                        Out of reach,
 In the sky
 Most of you, will never fly
 Afraid to fail, afraid to try
 But not me, I'd rather die The trick the Devil did,
 The trick the Devil did,
 The trick the Devil did,
 Was make me want it Oh no, I'm fighting for my soul
 I'm ready for the battle, most things I can handle
 Ohhh,
 Ohhh,
 Ohhh, The trick the Devil did,
 The trick the Devil did,
 The trick the Devil did,
 Was make me want it Long nights, longer road
 Up ahead, we're all alone
 And what I want, is what I'm owed,
 Too late to stay, too late to go, The trick the Devil did,
 The trick the Devil did,
 The trick the Devil did,
 Was make me want it Oh no, I'm fighting for my soul
 I'm ready for the battle, most things I can handle
 Oh no, I'm never letting go!
 I saw my name in blood, so I'm ready for the trouble
 Ohhh,
 Ohhh,
 Ohhh, The trick the Devil did,
 The trick the Devil did,
 The trick the Devil did,
 Was make me want it And I can't resist anything of temptation
 Oh no, I'm fighting for my soul
 I'm ready for the battle, most things I can handle
 Ohhh,
 Ohhh,
 Ohhh, The trick, The trick The trick the Devil did,
 Was make me want it
