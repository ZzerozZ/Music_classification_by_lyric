                        If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say
 For all the fools who fell for first girl who comes their way
 I've been down that road and now I'm back sitting on square one
 Trying to pick myself up where I started from
 I never would've thought that I'd see you out of control
 Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
 You should know between us, we was like mates of soul
 Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes You was more sort of chalant type I chose
 To more shows, on the true nights I suppose
 That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows
 In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
 So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
 And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
 But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
 We established this way before we became mates
 So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
 Get your desire when I retire and Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
 I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
 Lord, knows I was right 'cuz you just crossed the line
 Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine I used to say I never met a girl like you before
 Still ain't got a ***in' clue as to who you truly are
 Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
 'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
 Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
 Can't beleive I almost flew the coop for some stupid ***
 You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
 All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls If you recall I used to treat you like a poopie broad
 When we *** I refused to even take my jewlery off
 But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
 It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
 You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
 And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
 And who'da even knew that who would'a even thought possibly
 Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me It's true that I got shot in the heart
 But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
 But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
 'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
 Up under the seat, as your heart starts to beat
 Before you make a decision that's life altering
 And just as you halt, and you turn and you start to leave
 You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
 I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
 Lord, knows I was right 'cuz you just crossed the line
 Spend some time with me Yeah, right bitch, spend some time on my dick
 In most cases Stat's attitude is *** a bitch
 My only motive is to get head and *** a bitch
 But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
 Even held your hand in public
 We sufferin' because of this Shorty's on some hole another ***
 Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma tricked off rip
 I'll admit I was caught in the mix, down to commit
 Feeding you the best of me, I should've fed you piss We started off closer than close but who could've predicted to know
 Your triflin' way would've stopped our growth
 And the final result, back in that same boat
 I ask myself do I love these hoes, nope
 Em introduced us, "50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50"
 Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
 I complimented her, I said, "You have very nice lips"
 With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick We played the phone game, a week later *** changed fast
 Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some as
 Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
 Penthouse full of imported, you know how I grind
 She got the talkin', talkin' like an opportunitist too
 Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
 Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
 Yeah yeah, know how many times I done heard that ***? Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
 I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
 Lord, knows I was right 'cuz you just crossed the line
 Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
