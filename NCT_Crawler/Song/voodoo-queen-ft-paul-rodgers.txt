                        When the moon rises, the dogs will howl
 Look out of your window, I'll be on the prowl
 I'm not usually a gambling man
 But oh I just wanna hold up my hands And say I'm taking a chance on you love
 Woah I'm taking a chance on you love I'm not superstitious and I don't wear no charm
 I don't carry my heart on the sleeve of my arm
 Seven years of bad luck, please, don't worry me
 'Cause when I look in the mirror, here's the future I see I'm taking a chance on you love
 Woah, I'm taking a chance on you love Place your bets, better yet
 Don't forget, what I said
 Roll the dice, spin the wheel
 Always remember, you've got to keep it real Don't believe in voodoo, black magic was never my style
 But I believe you do, and it won't take much time
 To gather the portions that weave your magic spell
 The moon on the ocean has a secret to tell But anyway I'm taking a chance on you love
 Woah I'm taking a chance on you love
 Woah I'm taking a chance on you love
