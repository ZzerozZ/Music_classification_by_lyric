                        Calling Elvis
 Is anybody home?
 Calling Elvis
 I'm here all alone
 Did he leave the building?
 Or can he come to the phone?
 Calling Elvis
 I'm here all alone Well tell him I was calling
 Just to wish him well
 Let me leave my number
 Heartbreak hotel
 Oh love me tender
 Baby, don't be cruel
 Return to sender
 Treat me like a fool Calling Elvis
 Is anybody home?
 Calling Elvis
 I'm here all alone
 Did he leave the building?
 Can he come to the phone?
 Calling Elvis
 I'm here all alone
 Alright Why don't you go get him?
 I'm his biggest fan
 You gotta tell him
 He's still the man
 Long distance, baby
 So far from home
 Don't you think maybe
 You could put him on Tell him I was calling
 Just to wish him well
 Let me leave my number
 Heartbreak Hotel
 Oh, love me tender
 Baby, don't be cruel
 Return to sender
 Treat me like a fool Calling Elvis
 Is anybody home?

 Here all alone
 Did he leave the building?
 Or can he come to the phone?
 Calling Elvis

 Did he leave the building?
 Or can he come to the phone?
