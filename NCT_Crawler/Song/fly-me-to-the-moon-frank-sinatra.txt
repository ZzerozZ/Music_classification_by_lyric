                        Fly me to the moon
 Let me play among the stars
 Let me see what spring is like on
 A-Jupiter and Mars
 In other words, hold my hand
 In other words, baby, kiss me Fill my heart with song and let me sing for ever more
 You are all I long for
 All I worship and adore
 In other words, please be true
 In other words, I love you Fill my heart with song
 Let me sing for ever more
 You are all I long for, all I worship and adore
 In other words, please be true
 In other words, in other words
 In other words
 I love you
                        
                    |
