                        I got somethin' up my sleeve
 (I know you will cover me)
 Inside out and in between
 (I know you will cover me)
 I've got bruises on my knees
 (I know you will cover me)
 Inside out and in between
 (And I know you will cover me, yea, yea) Run away
 Make haste
 And get laid
 We get laid
 You turn me up
 I've had enough
 So medicate
 Medicate I'm already incomplete
 (I know you will cover me)
 Broken by your empathy
 (I know you will cover me)
 I've been lyin' here for weeks
 (I know you will cover me)
 Inside out and in between
 (And I know you will cover me, yea, yea) Run away
 Make haste
 And get laid
 We get laid
 You turn me up
 I've had enough
 So medicate
 Medicate Run away
 Make haste
 And get laid
 We get laid
 You turn me up
 I've had enough
 So medicate
 Medicate, yea, yea Run away
 Make haste
 And get laid
 We get laid
 You turn me up
 I've had enough
 So medicate
 Medicate
