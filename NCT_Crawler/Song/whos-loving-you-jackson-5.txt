                        When I (when I) had you (had you)
 I treated you bad
 And wrong my dear
 And girl since
 Since you been away
 Dont'cha know I
 Sit around
 With my head hangin' down
 And I wonder
 Who's lovin' you I, I, I, I
 Should have never ever
 Ever made you cry
 And girl since
 Since you been gone
 Dont'cha know I
 Sit around
 With my head hangin' down
 And I wonder
 Who's lovin' you Life without love
 Is oh, so lonely
 I don't think
 I don't think
 I'm gonna make it
 All my life (all my life)
 All my life, yeah (all my life)
 Belongs to you only
 Come on and take it girl
 Come on and take it
 Because
 All
 All I can do
 All I can do
 Since you been gone is cry
 And you, oooh
 Will never wonder
 And worry your pretty little head
 About what I do Dont'cha know I
 Sit around
 With my head hangin' down
 And I wonder
 Who's lovin' you
