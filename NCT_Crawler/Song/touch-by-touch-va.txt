                        Bài hát : Touch By Touch - V.A

When I feel the time is right and your staying by my side 
And the love you give to me makes my heart beat 
When my fantasy fly away but my feelings make me stay 
I see the fire in your eyes, it makes my heart beat 
Do it, we'll still do it night and day 
You're my all time lover 
Do it, we'll still do it anyway 
Like there is no other 
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover 
Skin to skin, come undone my cover 

When my heart full of love it makes me a turtle in dove 
Love the game that we play night and day 
When our love is clear and bright it's our way to see the light 
There's a fire in our heart night and day 
Do it, we'll still do it night and day 
You're my all time lover 
Do it, we'll still do it anyway 
Like there is no other 
Touch by touch, your my all time lover 
Skin to skin, come undone my cover 
Do it, we'll still do it night and day 
You're my all time lover 
Do it, we'll still do it anyway 
Like there is no other 
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover 
Skin to skin, come undone my covers 
Do it, we'll still do it night and day 
You're my all time lover 
Do it, we'll still do it anyway 
Like there is no other 
Touch by touch, your my all time lover 
Skin to skin, come undone my covers
                        
                    |
