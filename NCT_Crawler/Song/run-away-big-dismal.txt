                        Wake up in the morning
 Always rushing around
 Trying not to be late again
 'Cause it's no time to slow down I'm sick and tired of the same thing everyday
 Same old song the radio always plays
 I think, I need some time away
 But there's no place to go now I want to run away
 Leave it all behind
 We only have one life to live
 And it's your life so go on When the world gets the best of me
 All I need is a little company
 To put me back on my feet
 I hit so hard when I fall down Sometimes I feel like I just can't go on
 There's nothing left to keep me hanging on
 At the end of everyday
 All I want to do is run away It's your life so go on
 It's your life so be strong
 It's your life run away Leave it all behind
 We only have one life to live
 And it's your life so go on
 Run away Make your dreams come true
 We only have one life to live
 And it's your life so go on
 It's your life, so be strong
 Run away
