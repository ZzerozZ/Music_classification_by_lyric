                        Bài hát: Trouble Is A Friend - Lenka

Trouble – it will find you
No matter where you go
Oh, oh
No matter if you're fast
No matter if you're slow
Oh, oh

The eye of the storm
Or the cry in the morn
Oh, oh
You're fine for a while
But you start to lose control

He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the wings
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah
Trouble is a friend of mine
Ahh

Trouble is a friend
But trouble is a foe
Oh, oh
And no matter what I feed him
He always seems to grow
Oh, oh

He sees what I see
And he knows what I know
Oh, oh
So don't forget
As you ease on down my road

He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the wings
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah
Trouble is a friend of mine
Oh, oh

So don't be alarmed
If he takes you by the arm
I won't let him win
But I'm a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend
Yeah
Trouble is a friend of mine
Ahh

How I hate the way he makes me feel
And how I try to make him leave
I try
Oh, oh, I try

But he's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the wings
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah
Trouble is a friend of mine
Oh, oh

So don't be alarmed
If he takes you by the arm
I won't let him win
But I'm a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend
Yeah
Trouble is a friend of mine
Ahh

Ooh
Ahh
Ooh
