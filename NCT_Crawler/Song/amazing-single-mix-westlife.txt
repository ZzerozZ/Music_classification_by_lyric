                        Bài hát: Amazing (Single Mix) - Westlife

You're like a storm against the window
Follow me 'round just like a shadow
I'll swim a never ending ocean
Until you bring back your devotion

It's like I live a thousand lifetimes
Still looking for the one that feels right
See, moving on just isn't working
You lit the fire that I burn in

And all I've been doing is protecting
A lie for the sake of my pride
While all the others set me thinking
We could be more than just amazing

I guess I'm holding on to my faith
A solid hope, I'm heading your way
And crawling over is so tempting
We could be more than just amazing

And all I've been doing is protecting
A lie for the sake of my pride
While all the others set me thinking
We could be more than just amazing

I couldn't see it
I must have believed a lie
If I admit it, would you let me make it right?
Is it all gone? Oh no, say it all

We could be more than just
We could be more than just amazing

And all I've been doing is protecting
A lie for the sake of my pride
While all the others set me thinking
We could be more than just amazing

And all I've been doing is protecting
A lie for the sake of my pride
While all the others set me thinking
Straight to the point of what I'm feeling
Oh, we could be more than just amazing
                        
                    |
