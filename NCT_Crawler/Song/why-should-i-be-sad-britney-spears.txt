[00:-0.06]Title:Why Should I Be Sad
Artist:Britney Spears
Album:Blackout


They couldn't believe I did it
But I was so committed
My life was so restricted for you
I just told them set of lies
Couldn't see what's on inside
Thought there'd be real panic for you
Exchanged my vows And said it all
Woman, let's prepare to fall
Even, screaming did it for you (Remember it?)
My friends said you would play me
But I just said they're crazy
While I was crying, praying Was it true?
Well, should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Or should I get bad or sad
Who knows?
Just take it all As a sign that we're through
Goodbye
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (All right)
It's time for me(Britney, let's go)
I sent you to Vegas With a pocket roll of paper
Don't put no ultimatiums on you
I thought what could separate us
But it just seemed to break us
Only brought the playa part of you
(Hey baby, what's your name?)
Lavish homes and fancy cars
Even got the drop Ferrari
Filled up our garage for you
Made your choice with all the teams
People let us in magazines
Tell me who'd I do that for, who?
Why should I be sad?
From the stupid freaking things that you do(Stupid freaking things)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)
And don't you worry About our angels
(All the magazines trying to analyse
Seeing things in the Us subsection)
There'll get good guidance And be trained well
Don't worry I'll keep a little secret When I ask this question
Why should I get back the sack?
Yeah
Baby, come on
