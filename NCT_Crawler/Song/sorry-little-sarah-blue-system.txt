                        Oh you're crying like a child that lost his toy
In the shadows of your love
Do you think these tears I cry are tears of joy ?
'Cause my tears are not enough
I wanna kiss you, kiss you
I wanna miss you, miss you
I never want to lose your heart
You've got the best of me
Come take the rest of me, my love

Sorry little Sarah, Sarah
I'm waiting for a girl like you
Sorry little Sarah, Sarah
Dreams come true
Baby, I'm waiting for your call
I'm starring at the wall
Sorry little Sarah
Oh, I lose my selfcontrol

Don't you want me 'cause I'm the losing guy
Oh, don't take your love to town
Don't you see the rainbows baby on the sky
Oh, don't let it get you down
I wanna kiss you, kiss you
I never hurt you, hurt you
And it's too late to say goodbye
No one can love you more
What are you waiting for my love
                        
                    |
