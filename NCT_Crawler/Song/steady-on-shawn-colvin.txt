                        S. colvin - j. leventhal

 China gets broken
 And it will never be the same
 Boats on the ocean
 Find their way back again
 I am weaving
 Like a drunkard
 Like a balloon up in the air
 I am needing a puncture and someone
 To point me somewhere
 I'm gonna keep my head on straight
 I just hope it's not too late
 Open up the gate I go straight on, steady on


 Steady on!

 I was feeling imploded
 A wooden smile, a wooden heart
 The things exploded
 Like rockets in the dark
 Now I'm pulling out splinters
 And I'm off to hibernate somewhere
 For the nuclear winter
 Of another love affair


 'cause he seemed like a miracle
 I ate it up like cereal
 But it was something like shrapnel


 Steady on!

 It's like ten miles of a two-lane
 On a south dakota wheat plain
 In the middle of a hard rain
 A slow boat or a fast train
 I am gonna keep my head on straight
 I'm gonna keep my head on straight


 Steady on!
