                        Bài hát: Seen It All - Jake Bugg

One Friday night I took a pill or maybe two
Down at the car park I saw everyone I knew
And before the night had started we had planned to crash a party
Just a place that someone knew a local house belonging to a gangsters crew 
And at the door they shone a light into my face
Have to admit I felt a little out of place
But I made my way inside past a thousand crazy eyes
Then a friend took me aside said everyone here has a knife

I've seen it all
I've seen it all now
I swear to god I've seen it all
Nothing shocks me anymore after tonight 

Those little doves had sent my mind and heart a-beating
To say I felt weird really doesn't need repeating
I could sense the mounting tension the atmosphere of violence 
And then they took a guy out side and someone stabbed him with a knife

I've seen it all
I've seen it all now I swear to god
I've seen it all nothing shocks me anymore after tonight

I've seen it all
I've seen it all now
I've seen it all,
I've seen it all now I swear to god 
I've seen it all nothing shocks me anymore after tonight
I've seen the light but not the kind I would have liked
                        
                    |
