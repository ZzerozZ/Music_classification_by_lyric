                        Bài hát : Summer Nights (Deep House Remix) - Tiesto, John Legend

I see you in my head
(You ain't like the rest...)
You ain't bringin' me down, baby!
You're right next to me
We're makin' history
The sun's about to go down, baby!

(Oooooooooh)
I wanna be wherever you are, baby
(Oooooooooh)
Impossible to take it too far

Summer nights, gettin' high like the first time
You and I, makin' lust forever
Summer nights, gettin' high like the first time
You and I, makin' lust forever
You and I, makin' lust forever
Makin' lust forever

I see you in my bed
Gettin' undressed
It's about to go down, baby
It wasn't just a dream
I guess it's meant to be
I got to tell you right now, baby

(Oooooooooh)
I wanna be wherever you are, baby!
(Oooooooooh)
Impossible to take it too far

Summer nights, gettin' high like the first time
You and I, makin' lust forever
Summer nights, gettin' high like the first time
You and I, makin' lust forever

Summer nights, gettin' high like the first time
You and I, makin' lust forever
Summer nights, gettin' high like the first time 
You and I, makin' lust forever

(Baby oooooooooh yeah)

Making lust forever...
