                        This is going out to the whole wide Westside
 You know what I'm saying,
 Yeah break it down for me
 Steady mob, rock, rock on

 I was just a young boy, livin in the hub city-Eastside Compton G
 Back in the days when Ice Cube and Eazy had every nigga
 Talking 'bout boy you can't *** with me
 Remember Ice T had da power, hearing gunshots lickin' by the hour
 When Too Short bumped in every supersport
 And taught us all how to ride for the West Coast

 [Chorus:]
 To my peoples if you with me - where you at
 Throw your dubs in the air - and wave 'em like you just don't care
 From la to the Bay - what you say - all day... Everyday... Any damn day
 Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
 Going on and on, it don't stop... Won't stop... Can't stop
 Either ride or die - that's why I put it down for the westside

 Didn't seem that long ago, (oh no) we were stealing 40's out the liquor store (oh no)
 Mama started tripping so it's time to go
 Up to the park with the locsta's
 Everybody broke, smokin' roaches
 Dj Quik was the *** had every nigga claiming he was from the cpt
 Ya'll remember one-time tried to clown
 We had to burn this bitch on down

 [Bridge:]
 One time for my niggas in incarceration
 I blaze a dime with you for having lots of patience
 Two times for my sista's at the county building
 I got some Westside love for all you ghetto children
 Three times for my niggas that done passed away
 I tip some gin for you and pray for better days
 One day everything's gonna be fine
 But until that day my only reply is...
 Westsdie till I die

 [Chorus:]
 To my peoples if you with me - where you at
 Throw your dubs in the air - and wave 'em like you just don't care
 From la to the Bay - what you say - all day... Everyday... Any damn day
 Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
 Going on and on, it don't stop... Won't stop... Can't stop
 Either ride or die - gotta give it up for the Westside

 From Crenshaw to Foothill Blvd.
 All I see are Lo Lo's and mob cars - Daytons and five stars
 All the true hobs is hittin' switches
 With all the finest riches of course the bombest bitches
 Don't get it twisted Ask me what's a real G
 Show me a nigga scrapping back against the wall until his knuckles bleed
 Screaming death to all our enemies and those who don't believe
 West coast livin' be the *** to me!!!

 [Bridge:]
 One time for my niggas in incarceration
 I blaze a dime with you for having lots of patience
 Two times for my sista's at the county building
 I got some love for all you ghetto children
 Three times for my niggas that done passed away
 I tip some gin for you and pray for better days
 One day everything's gonna be fine
 But until that day my only reply is...
 Westside till I die

 [Chorus:]
 To my peoples if you with me - where you at
 Throw your dubs in the air - and wave 'em like you just don't care
 From la to the Bay - what you say - all day... Everyday... Any damn day
 Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
 Going on and on, it don't stop... Won't stop... Can't stop
 Either ride or die - gotta give it up for the Westside

 To my peoples if you with me - where you at
 Throw your dubs in the air - and wave 'em like you just don't care
 From la to the Bay - what you say - all day... Everyday... Any damn day
 Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
 Going on and on, it don't stop... Won't stop... Can't stop
 Either ride or die - La la la la la la la la

 To my peoples if you with me - where you at
 Throw your dubs in the air - and wave 'em like you just don't care
 From la to the Bay - what you say - all day... Everyday... Any damn day
 Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
 Going on and on, it don't stop... Won't stop... Can't stop
 Either ride or die - tq gonna give it up for the Westside

 To my peoples if you with me - where you at
 Throw your dubs in the air - and wave 'em like you just don't care
 From la to the Bay - what you say - all day... Everyday... Any damn day
 Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
 Going on and on, it don't stop... Won't stop... Can't stop
 Either ride or die - gotta give it up for the Westside
