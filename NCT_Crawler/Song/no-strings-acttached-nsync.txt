                        Baby you're not the only one...
Oh oh oh yeah
Hey yeah

JC:

I see the things he does to you
All the pain that he puts you through
And I see what's really going on
Staying out at night while you're by the phone

Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
See I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of

Baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it, here's my heart

No strings attached

Justin:

He doesn't give you the kind of attention
That a girl like you needs (that a girl like you needs)
Cause he always looks around
His eyes wander 'round
He doesn't see you like I see

Take it from me

It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned

Take it from me

Baby I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of yeah
Baby you're not the only one (baby you're not the only one)
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love (to fall in love)

And I know that you've hurt in the past (hurt in the past)
But if you want it, here's my heart (here's my heart)

No strings attached

Take it from me

JC: It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned

Take it from me

JC & Justin: See I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of
JC: So if you want to take a chance with me (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

If you (baby) take a chance with me
I'll be everything you need (everything you need)
Because it's our destiny

(Mixing of chorus and "If you...take a chance with me")

Baby you're not the only one (baby you're not the only one)
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love (you don't have to be afraid)

And I know that you've hurt in the past (know that you're hurting)
But if you want it, here's my heart (if you want here's my heart)
No strings attached
