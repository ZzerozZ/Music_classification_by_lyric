                        Koda:
Tell everybody I'm on my way

New friends and new places to see

With blue skies ahead, yes I'm on my way

And there's nowhere else that I'd rather be

Phil Collins:

Tell everybody I'm on my way

And I'm loving every step I take

With the sun beating down, yes I'm on my way

And I can't keep this smile off my face

Cause there's nothing like seeing each other again

No matter what the distance between

And the stories we tell will make you smile

Oh it really lifts my heart

So tell 'em all I'm on my way

New friends and new places to see

And to sleep under the stars

Who could ask for more

With the moon keeping watch over me

Not the snow, not the rain

Can change my mind

The sun will come out, wait and see

And the feeling of the wind

In your face can lift your heart

Oh, there's no where I would rather be

Cause I'm on my way now

Well and truly

I'm on my way now (I'm on my way now)

Tell everybody

I'm on my way

I just can't wait to be there (just can't wait to be there)

With blue skies ahead, yes

I'm on my way

And nothing but good times to share

So tell everybody I'm on my way

And I just can't wait to be home (just can't wait to be home)

With the sun beating down yes

I'm on my way

And nothing but good times to show

I'm on my way

Koda: Yes, I'm on my way
