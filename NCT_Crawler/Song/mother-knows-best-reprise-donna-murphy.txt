                        I think he likes me.
 Likes you? Please, Rapunzel, that's demented.
 This is why you never should have left
 Dear, this whole romance that you've invented
 Just proves you're too naive to be here
 Why would he like you? Come on now - really!
 Look at you - you think that he's impressed?
 Don't be a dummy
 Come with mummy
 Mother -
 No!
 No?! Oh. I see how it is.
 Rapunzel knows best
 Rapunzel's so mature now
 Such a clever grown-up miss
 Rapunzel knows best
 Fine, if you're so sure now
 Go ahead, then give him this
 This is why he's here!
 Don't let him deceive you!
 Give it to him, watch, you'll see!
 Trust me, my dear
 That's how fast he'll leave you
 I won't say I told you so - no
 Rapunzel knows best!
 So if he's such a dreamboat
 Go and put him to the test
 If he's lying
 Don't come crying
 Mother knows best...
