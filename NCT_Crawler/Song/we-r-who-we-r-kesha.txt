                        Song : We R Who We R
Singer : Ke$ha

Hot and dangerous
If you're one of us, then roll with us
'Cause we make the hipsters fall in love
And we've got hotpants on enough
And yes of course we does
we're running this town just like a club
And no, you don't wanna mess with us
Got Jesus on my necklace

I've got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side

Looking sick and sexy-fied

So let's go-o-o (Let's go!)

Tonight we're going hard
Just like the world is ours
We're tearin' it apart
You know we're superstars
We are who we are!

We're dancing like we're dumb
Our bodies go numb
We'll be forever young
You know we're superstars
We are who we are!

DJ turn it up
It's about damn time to live it up
I'm so sick of being so serious
It's making my brain delirious!

I'm just talkin' truth
I'm telling you 'bout the sh*t we do
We're sellin' our clothes, sleepin' in cars
Dressin' it down, hittin' on dudes (HARD!)

I've got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexy-fied
So let's go-o-o (Let's go!)
Tonight we're going hard
Just like the world is ours
We're tearin' it apart
You know we're superstars
We are who we are!

We're dancing like we're dumb
Our bodies go numb
We'll be forever young
You know we're superstars
We are who we are!
DJ turn it up
DJ turn it up
DJ turn it up
DJ turn it up

Tonight we're going hard
Just like the world is ours
We're tearin' it apart
You know we're superstars
We are who we are!

We're dancing like we're dumb
Our bodies go numb
We'll be forever young
You know we're superstars
We are who we are!
OW!
