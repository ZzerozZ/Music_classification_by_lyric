                        Bài hát: Bang My Head - David Guetta, Sia, Fetty Wap

I was bound, was tied
Hadn't seen a light so long
Thought I lost my fight
Couldn't find my way back home
And I found the light stepping out of me
I was bound, and tied
Waiting for daylight and I...

Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed
I should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all

Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)

(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
(ZooVier, 1738)
I been climbing up the wall, going through it all, baby

It's so hard to live your life when you gave it up, baby
For the fans and the cameras
Different places, adventures
And the stress that it brings, start to wonder if it's worth it
I live life like it's perfect
My children are smiling and that makes me happy
Cause how I was living, I swear it had me

Bouncing my head off the wall
I am too far up, I cannot fall
Having fun, I don't know about y'all
It's ZooVier from ZooGang, I'm the boss
For my kids, give my life with no thought

You will find what you're searching for
And you might feel light headed
You think you're gonna fall on the floor
Instead you rise above it all

Oh, oh, oh
Bang your head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
