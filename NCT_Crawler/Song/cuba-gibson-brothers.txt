                        Chorus
 Cuba quiero bailar la salsa,
 Cuba quiero bailar la salsa.

 You dance to the music like nobody does.
 The first time I saw you, I knew it was love.

 Chorus

 My heart is on fire, the night is divine,
 My only desire is making you mine.
 You're the one that I want,
 you're the one, yes, you are.

 Chorus

 You dance to the music like nobody does.
 The first time I saw you, I knew it was love.
 You're the one that I want,
 You're the one, yes, you are.
 You're the one that I want,
 You're the one, yes, you are.

 Chorus 2x
