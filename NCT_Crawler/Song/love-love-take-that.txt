                        You bring me right back down to the earth from the promised land
We’re getting close to the center of the earth with an honest plan
You’ll never be your mother or your father do you understand
Do you understand

We don’t have too much time here
And time it travels far too fast
We’re not too far we’re down here
Before they take it from our hands

Why don’t you teach your heart to feel
And give you love love
Give you love love
Give it all away
Why don’t you teach your heart to talk
And give you love love
Give you love love
Give me give me what I need

We’ll take you right back down to the earth from the mother land
This is a first class journey from the Gods to the son of man
You’re at the gates of human evolution don’t you understand
Why don’t you understand
Understand

We don’t have too much time here
And time it travels far too fast
We’re not too far we’re down here
Before they take it from our hands

Why don’t you teach your heart to feel
And give you love love
Give you love love
Give it all away
Why don’t you teach your heart to talk
And give you love love
Give you love love
Give it all away
Why don’t you teach your heart to feel
And give you love love
Give you love love
Give it all away
Why don’t you teach your heart to talk
And give you love love
Give you love love
Give me give me what I need

We don’t have too much time here
And time it travels far too fast
We’re not too far we’re down here
Before they take it from our hands

Why don’t you teach your heart to feel
And give you love love
Give you love love
Give it all away
Why don’t you teach your heart to talk
And give you love love
Give you love love
Give it all away
Why don’t you teach your heart to feel
And
                        
                    |
