                        I wanna share my dreams, wanna share with you
On the wings of love like dreamers do
Touch your heart, you're the queen of broken hearts

Oh, we are daytime friends and nighttime fools
Wanna play this game, you break the rules
Tears of love are frozen tears

Geronimo's Cadillac is making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac, oh making all girls too sad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag

Geronimo's Cadillac, it's tossing oh in your head
It's tossing and turning, it's burning it makes you mad
Geronimo's Cadillac, oh baby I'll hold you back
You're tossing and turning, it's burning, it makes you sad

I'm looking through the eyes, the eyes of love
They made a fool of me, can't get enough
Touch my heart, boulevard of broken dreams

Another time for love other place to be
Don't let him take your love, your love from me
Tears of love are frozen tears

Geronimo's Cadillac is making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac, oh making all girls too sad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag

Geronimo's Cadillac, it's tossing oh in your head
It's tossing and turning, it's burning it makes you mad
Geronimo's Cadillac, oh baby I'll hold you back
You're tossing and turning, it's burning, it makes you sad

Geronimo's Cadillac is making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
                        
                    |
