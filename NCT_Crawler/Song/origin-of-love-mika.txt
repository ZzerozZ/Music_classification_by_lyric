                        Bài hát: Origin Of Love - Mika

Love is a drug and you are my cigarette
Love is addiction and you are my Nicorette
Love is a drug, like chocolate, like cigarettes
I'm feeling sick, I've got to medicate myself

I want your love, don't try and stop me
Can't get enough, still hanging on me
Your guilty heart, don't let it break you
And if you pray, well, no one's gonna save you

Like everyone that you fear
And everything you hold dear
Even the book in your pocket
You are the sun and the light
You are the freedom I fight
God will do nothing to stop it

The origin is you
You're the origin of love

Love is a drug and you are my cigarette
Love is addiction and you are my Nicorette
Love is a drug, like chocolate, like cigarettes
I'm feeling sick, I've got to medicate myself

Well if God is a priest and the devil a slut
Well there's a reason for nothing
Like every word that you preach
Like every word that you teach
With every rule that you breach
You know the origin is you

From the air I breathe
To the love I need
Only thing I know
Is you're the origin of love
From the God above
To the one I love
Only thing that's true
The origin is you
(x2)

Madre Deus Deus machismo
Madre Deus Deus machismo
Dio de madre Deus machismo
Deus eso santo spirito

Like stupid Adam and Eve
They found their love in a tree
God didn't think they deserved it
He taught them hate, taught them pride
Gave them a leaf, made them hide
Let's push their stories aside
You know the origin is you

From the air I breathe
To the love I need
Only thing I know
Is you're the origin of love
From the God above
To the one I love
Only thing that's true
The origin is you
(x2)

Some love's a pill and some love is a candy cane
It tastes so sweet but leaves you feeling sick with pain
Your love is air, I breathe it in around me
Don't know it's there but without it I'm drowning

Love
You're the origin of love
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love (repeat)
Thank God that you found me
Thank God that you found me
Thank God that you found me
Thank God that you found me
