                        Bài hát: It Had To Be You - Frank Sinatra

 Why do I do just as you say
 Why must I just give you your way
 Why do I sigh
 Why don't I try to forget It must have been that something lovers call fate
 Kept me saying "I had to wait"
 I saw them all
 Just couldn't fall 'til we met It had to be you, it had to be you
 I've wandered around, finally found somebody who
 Could make me be true
 Could make me be blue
 And, even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you Some others I've seen
 Might never be mean
 Might never be cross
 Or, try to be boss
 But, they wouldn't do For nobody else gave me a thrill
 With all your faults, I love you still
 It had to be you, wonderful you
 It had to be you 'Cause nobody else gave me a thrill
 With all your faults, I love you still now
 And it had to be you, it just had to be you
 It had to be you
                        
                    |
