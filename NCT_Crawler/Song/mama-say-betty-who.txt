                        Song: Mama Say - Betty Who

Come with me, I'm what you need
I light you up, 'cause I can see the fire in your eyes
Welcome to your fantasy, your wildest dreams
I'll show you things you never knew you liked

What if we kiss just like this?
Go insane tonight?

What would your mama say?
What would your mama say?

You know you love a pretty girl with a twisted mind
And you love it when my lovin' hurts, you tell me all the time
So don't apologize, give it to me one more time
You know you love a pretty girl
What would your mama say?

Take me on the floor
Yeah, I adore the way it's yours
And no one else can do it right (it right)
Elevator, kitchen table, any flavor, what's your favorite?
Tell me what you like (you like)

Look at you now, make me proud
I'm your slave tonight

What would your mama say?
What would your mama say?

You know you love a pretty girl with a twisted mind
And you love it when my lovin' hurts, you tell me all the time
So don't apologize, give it to me one more time
You know you love a pretty girl
What would your mama say?

Ooh, baby, look at you now
You love a pretty girl and her twisted mind
So good, it hurts, oh baby
Don't apologize, don't you know that I'm just a pretty girl?

You know you love a pretty girl with a twisted mind
And you love it when my lovin' hurts, you tell me all the time
So don't apologize, give it to me one more time
You know you love a pretty girl
What would your mama say?
You know you love a pretty girl with a twisted mind
And you love it when my lovin' hurts, you tell me all the time
So don't apologize, give it to me one more time
You know you love a pretty girl
What would your mama say?
