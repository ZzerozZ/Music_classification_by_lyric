                        (A.E. on the tracks)
 Jammin' my music live
 (Soulja Boy Tell 'Em)
 His own fault it's a gas DJ turn me up, do not turn me down
 Just gon' turn me up
 Roscoe, that's what's up And shawty we
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up DJ turn me up, crank me to the max
 I got lots of wallet, I be blowin' stacks
 Polo on my ***, shoes turnt to the max
 I be so turnt up, I be swaggin' to the max If you get it in, and you gettin' dough
 Gon' pop a bottle, this right here yo' song
 Purple bottoms on, you can smell it on my clothes
 And a man up in my switcher, 'bout to take one to the dogs I'm gone, in another song
 I'll be ridin' on your itchy with the woofer goin' strong
 They like, "What is goin' on?" I don't really know
 Then I roll down all my windows and I crank that s*** up all the way And shawty we
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up Hopped up out the bed, what's happenin'?
 Soulja Boy Tell 'Em they can turn on to my level, man
 Yeah, money on the table
 All up in Mexico, gettin' to the peso Whoa, check out the gear
 If money was a sport, I'm gon' beat it every year
 We gettin' money over here
 And well, I know where I'm from Yo' girl spinnin' on my d*** just like a CD-ROM
 Turn up, turn up 'til you can't turn no mo'
 Burn up 'til you can't burn no mo'
 I rock my chain everywhere I go Smoke 'til you can't smoke no mo'
 Choke 'til you can't choke no mo'
 Work 'til you can't work no mo'
 I'm rich, I can't go work no mo' And shawty we
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up Turn up, all I know is turn up
 Smokin' like a hippie, that's why all I do is burn up
 All in V.I.P., and they be actin' like they know us
 I'm like we turn up, excuse while I turn up All these h*** be choosy, but I turnt it up the whole way
 I turnt up on the wrong, I be turnt up off the cold
 All these n***** back 'cause I be pullin' all they h***
 Once I get 'em to the room, they be turnt off all they clothes like And I be goin' ham
 I don't think these n***** really know just who I am
 This is R-O-S-C-O-E Dash, and just got some cash
 But for short, you can call me Mr. Way Too Turnt Up For That And shawty we
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up
 All the way turnt up All the way turnt up
 Soulja Boy turnt up
 Turnt up, turnt up
 (Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up)
 All the way, all the way, all the way turnt up
 (Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up)
