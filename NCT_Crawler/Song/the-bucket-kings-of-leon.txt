                        I'll be the one to show you the way
 You'll be the one to always complain
 Three in the morning, come a-bang-bang-bang
 All out of fags and I just can't wait
 Cancel the thing that I said I'd do
 I don't feel comfortable talking to you
 Unless you got the zipper fixed on my shoe
 Then I'll be in the lobby drinking for two Eighteen, balding, star
 Golden, fallen heart Look at the shakies, what's with the blush?
 Fresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush
 Everyone's gathered to idolize me
 I hate the way you talk, your Japanese scream
 It's been too long since I've left the shed
 You kick the bucket, I'll swing my legs
 Always remember the pact that we made
 Too young to die, but old is the grave Eighteen, balding, star
 Golden, fallen heart I'ma gonna show the way.
 I'ma gonna show the way.
 I'ma gonna show the way.
 I'ma gonna show the way. Eighteen, balding, star
