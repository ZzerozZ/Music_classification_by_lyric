                        Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
 The way that I want you to die
 Slow death, immense decay
 Showers that cleanse you of your life Forced in like cattle you run
 Stripped of your life's worth
 Human mice, for the angel of death
 Four hundred thousand more to die Angel of death
 Monarch to the kingdom of the dead Sadistic, surgeon of demise
 Sadist of the noblest blood
 Destroying, without mercy
 To benefit the Aryan race Surgery, with no anesthesia
 Feel the knife pierce you intensely
 Inferior, no use to mankind
 Strapped down screaming out to die Angel of death
 Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
 Infamous butcher
 Angel of death Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
 Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
 Burning flesh, drips away
 Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil Frigid cold, cracks your limbs
 How long can you last in this frozen water burial?
 Sewn together, joining heads just a matter of time
 'Til you rip yourselves apart Millions laid out in their
 Crowded tombs
 Sickening ways to achieve
 The holocaust Seas of blood, bury life
 Smell your death as it burns deep inside of you
 Abacinate, eyes that bleed
 Praying for the end of your wide awake nightmare Wings of pain, reach out for you
 His face of death staring down your blood running cold
 Injecting cells, dying eyes
 Feeding on the screams of the mutants hes creating Pathetic harmless victims
 Left to die
 Rancid angel of death
 Flying free Angel of death
 Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
 Infamous butcher
 Angel of death
 Angel of death
