                        Bài hát : In Your Life (Remix 2014) - DJ Minh Anh, La Bouche

In your life x8
In your life
Like sitting on a ferris wheel
Watching the world go around and around it goes
Maybe that's how lovers feel
Up and down, where it stops nobody knows

How many tears
or How many broken hearts
Just how many sorrows
How much you'll take
In your life

In your life x8

No body knows, Ole Ole Ole ola

Lonely heart of a little boy
Waiting for his daddy with a brand new toy
Lonely eyes of a pretty little girl
Bet

How many tears
or How many broken hearts
Just how many sorrows
How much you'll take
In your life

In your life x8

No body knows, Ole Ole Ole ola
In your life
No body knows, Ole Ole Ole ola

For god so loved the world
He gave his only begotten son
That who so ever believed in him
Shall not perish
But have everlasting life

No body knows

I know I could be in your life
Forever in your life
I know I should be by your side
Forever in your life
Cause this is what it all comes down to
In your life
This is what it all comes down to
In your life

In your life x8

No body knows, Ole Ole Ole ola
In your life
No body knows, Ole Ole Ole ola

No body knows, Ole Ole Ole ola
In your life
No body knows, Ole Ole Ole ola

In your life
                        
                    |
