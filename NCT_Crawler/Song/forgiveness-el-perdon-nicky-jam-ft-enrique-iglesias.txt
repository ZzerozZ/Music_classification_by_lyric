                        Bài hát: Forgiveness (El Perdon) - Nicky Jam, Enrique Iglesias

[Enrique:]
I know you moved on
I heard you're doin' better without me
Girl this is drivin' me crazy
Can't you see what you're doin' on me
[Nicky Jam:]
She let go
She killed me when she said it was over
Now I'm in the middle of nowhere
And got no space to breath

[Enrique:]
I'm missing you baby
Up all night goin' crazy
Now my angel can't save me
Oh no!!!
[Nicky Jam:]
I'm missing you baby
Up all night goin' crazy
Drinking my pain away-ehh-hey

[Enrique:]
Girl I'm not with you, you're not with me
And I don't like the way it feels
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
[Nicky Jam:]
Girl I'm not with you, you're not with me
And I don't like the way this feels
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

[Enrique:]
Can't take the pain, can't take the hurt
I wish that I could turn back in time and say 'I Love You'
I'd do anything to make it work
[Nicky Jam:]
'Cause even through the times they try to hate on us
The only thing that mattered to me was our love
I never wanna stop and I never get enough
[Enrique:]
I'm missing you baby
Up all night goin' crazy
Now my angel can't save me
Oh no!!!
[Nicky Jam:]
I'm missing you baby
Up all night goin' crazy
Drinking my pain away-ehh-hey

[Enrique:]
Girl I'm not with you, you're not with me
And I don't like the way it feels
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
[Nicky Jam:]
Girl I'm not with you, you're not with me
And I don't like the way this feels
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

[Enrique:]
I know they say that you're moving on
But I'm begging you please don't go
No I don't wanna let you go!
Oh no!
[Nicky Jam:]
Yeah you know that I want you back
Baby I love you to the max
From here to the moon and back!

[Enrique:]
Girl I'm not with you, you're not with me
And I don't like the way this feels
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
[Nicky Jam:]
Girl I'm not with you, you're not with me
And I don't like the way it feels
Esto no me gusta-ahh
Oh yeah! Oh.

(Tú sin mí)
Dicen que uno no sabe lo que tiene
Hasta que lo pierde pero...
(Yo sin ti)
Vale la pena luchar por lo que uno quiere
(No puedo vivir así)
Y hacer el intento
(No quiero vivir así)
