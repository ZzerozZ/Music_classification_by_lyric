                        Bài hát: Rockabye Cover - Madilyn Bailey

She works the night, by the water
She's gonna stress, so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby

All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him
She tells him "ooh love"

No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you
She tells him "your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life

I'm gonna do what I've got to do"
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you

Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye
Single mom what you doing out there?
Facing the hard life without no fear
Just see and know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come you well prepared
And no mamma you never shed tear
'Cause you haffi set things year after year
And you give the youth love beyond compare

You find the school fee and the bus fare
Hmmmm more when paps disappear
In a wrong bar can't find him nowhere
Steadily you work flow, heavily you know so you nah stop
No time no time fi a jeer
Now she gotta a six year old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep all the cold
When he looks her in the eyes
He don't know he's safe when she says
"Ooh love"
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love

I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry

Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye
