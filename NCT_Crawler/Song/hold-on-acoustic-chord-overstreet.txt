                        Bài hát: Hold On (Acoustic) - Chord Overstreet

Hold on
[Verse 1] 
Loving and fighting 
Accusing, united 
I can't imagine a world with you gone 
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of 
I'd be so lost if you left me alone 
You locked yourself in the bathroom 
Lying on the floor when I break through 
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat 
Can you hear me screaming please don't leave me 

[Chorus] 
Hold on, I still want you 
Come back, I still need you 
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right 
I swear to love you all my life 
Hold on, I still need you 

[Verse 2] 
A long endless highway, you're silent beside me 
Drivin' a nightmare I can't escape from 
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fadin' 
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones 
They took you away on a table 
I pace back and fourth as you lay still 
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat 
Can you hear me screaming, please don't leave me 

[Chorus] 
Hold on, I still want you 
Come back, I still need you 
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right 
I swear to love you all my life 
Hold on, I still need you 

[Bridge] 
I don't wanna let go 
I know I'm not that strong 
I just wanna hear you 
Saying baby, let's go home 
Let's go home 
Yeah, I just wanna take you home 

[Outro] 
Hold on, I still want you 
Come back, I still need you
                        
                    |
