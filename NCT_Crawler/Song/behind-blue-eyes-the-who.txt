                        Bài hát: Behind Blue Eyes - The Who

No one knows what it's like 
to be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows
What it's like to be hated
To be fated to telling only lies

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
to feel these feelings like I do, and I blame you!
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woe can show through

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what its like
to be mistreated, to be defeated
Behind blue eyes...
No one knows how to say
that they're sorry and don't worry
I'm not telling lies

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
to be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes.
