                        Bài hát: You Are The Reason - Calum Scott

There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
There goes my mind racing

And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean

Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking

And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
If I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day

Keeping you safe
And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken

Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
You are the reason
I'm a little sad
Just a little sad

I'm a little sad
I need you to hold me tonight
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you

And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
                        
                    |
