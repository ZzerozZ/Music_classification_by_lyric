                        Bài hát: Small Bump - Ed Sheeran

You're just a small bump unborn, in four months you're brought to life, You might be left with my hair, but you'll have your mother's eyes, I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can, but for now your scan of my unmade plans, A small bump in four months, you're brought to life I'll whisper quietly, I'll give you nothing but truth, If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you You are my one and only. You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight. You are my one and only. You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight. And you will be alright. You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin. With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin. Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice, And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes. And I'll hold you tightly, I'll give you nothing but truth, If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you You are my one and only. You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight. Oh, you are my one and only. You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight. And you will be alright. You can lie with me, With your tiny feet When you're half asleep, I'll leave you be. Right in front of me For a couple weeks So I can keep you safe. 'Cause you are my one and only. You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight. You are my one and only. You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight. And you will be alright. You were just a small bump unborn for four months then torn from life. Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why.
