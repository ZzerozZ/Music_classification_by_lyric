                        Song: It'S Your Move - Josh Kelley

Walk out the door, go on, do it
Stop bringing me down
You make all these threats you don't mean
Stop playing me now

Wake up, wake up
Don't screw this up

Do you want me to stop you?
Should I make a scene?
Throw my beer at the wall?
Do you want me to scream that I don't really love you?
Cause I really do
Girl, I don't wanna fight
I've got nothing to prove
If you want this as bad as I do, then it's your move
It's your move

If our ship's going down, I don't care
I just wanna be on it
Cause we built something beautiful here
And God I still want it, yeah

Wake up, wake up
Don't give this up

Do you want me to stop you?
Should I make a scene?
Throw my beer at the wall?
Do you want me to scream that I don't really love you?
Cause I really do
Girl, I don't wanna fight
I've got nothing to prove
If you want this as bad as I do, then it's your move
It's your move

If you're gonna leave, then just leave
But I don't want you to
I don't want you to

You want me to stop you
Should I make a scene?
Throw my beer at the wall?
Do you want me to scream that I don't really love you?
Cause I really do
Girl, I don't wanna fight
I've got nothing to prove
If you want this as bad as I do, then it's your move
It's your move
It's your move
It's your move, yeah
