                        She's a heartbeat
 Yeah, she's a heartbeat
 She's a door at the end of a dead end street
 She's a heartbeat
 And footsteps I hear her footsteps
 Here comes rumours and lies
 Here comes my life of crime
 I hear footsteps
 When the music goes down
 And the traffic is stopped
 And nobody talks at all
 When they turn up the town
 I hear a heartbeat
 And I've shut all the shades
 And the radio stops
 And nobody moves at all
 When the city's asleep
 I hear a heartbeat
 I hear a heartbeat
 In the shadows
 Out in the shadows
 It's like walking on glass
 It's the end of the show
 In the shadows
 And sweet dreams
 She sells you sweet dreams
 It's like movies and trash
 Where there's always a girl
 And she's sweet dreams
 When the music goes down
 And the traffic is stopped
 And nobody talks at all
 When they turn up the town
 I hear a heartbeat
 And I've shut all the shades
 And the radio stops
 And nobody moves at all
 When the city's asleep
 I hear a heartbeat
 I hear a heartbeat
 Heartbeat
