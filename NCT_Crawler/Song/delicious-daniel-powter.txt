                        Bài hát: Delicious - Daniel Powter

[Verse 1]
You look so delicious
The way your body moves
Cherry lipstick kisses
Sends me to the moon
You got me so excited
Come wrap your legs around me
Let's get on it

[Chorus]
You're so delicious
Wanna take a bite
Baby it's on tonight
Let's stop wasting time
Just wanna touch you
Make you feel alright
I can do what you like
Cause baby I'm yours tonight
You're so delicious

[Refrain]
You gotta work harder than that

[Verse 2]
Show me no mercy
I like the games you play
Now tie me to your bedpost honey
Keep me there all day
Legs that go to heaven
Driving me insane
Let's get on it

[Chorus]
You're so delicious
Wanna take a bite
Baby it's on tonight
Let's stop wasting time
Just wanna touch you
Make you feel alright
I can do what you like
Cause baby I'm yours tonight
You're so delicious

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Now you feel good
And girl you look so fine
Now woo, I can hardly stand it
You know just how to make a grown man cry

[Chorus]
You're so delicious
Wanna take a bite
Baby it's on tonight
Let's stop wasting time
Just wanna touch you
Make you feel alright
I can do what you like
Cause baby I'm yours tonight
You're so delicious

[Outro]
Oh wah ooh ooh
You're so delicious
Uh huh
Baby, baby, baby you're so delicious
Aw now
Oh wah ooh ooh
You're so delicious
                        
                    |
