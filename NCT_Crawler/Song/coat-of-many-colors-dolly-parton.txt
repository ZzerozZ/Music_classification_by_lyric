                        Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
 Back to the seasons of my youth
 I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
 And how my momma put the rags to use There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
 And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
 Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
 She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
 About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
 "Perhaps this coat will brang you good luck and happiness"
 And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
 Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
 In my coat of many colors my momma made for me So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
 In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
 Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
 and my coat of many colors my momma made for me And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
 And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
 And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
 And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
 One is only poor only if you choose to be It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
 In my coat of many colors momma made for me
 Made just for me
