                        Song: The Weekend - Brantley Gilbert

Tick tock, I'm on the clock
And I'm feeling like this job's
Just nine to fivin' my life away
It's like I'm back at school
And I'm in the last class
And I'm passin' time until the bell rang
Havin' visions of summertime
Wait a minute now, that's just later tonight
Tan legs and tailgates all up in the moonlight
And by the way
It's payday

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot full of regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Backwoods lookin' like Panama City
Bunch of jacked-up trucks and bikinis
Got a yeti full of good ideas
Like I Ain't worried about drivin' 
I'mma stay right here

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot full of regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
We live it up for the weekend
We live it up for the weekend

Somebody said somethin' 'bout church on Sunday, Amen
Somebody said somethin' 'bout work on Monday
Don't say it again

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot full of regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
Live it up for the weekend

Live it up
Live it up for the weekend
C'mon
Live it up 
Live it up for the weekend
Live it up 
Live it up
It's the weekend
