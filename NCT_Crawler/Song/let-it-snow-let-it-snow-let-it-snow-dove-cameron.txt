                        Bài hát: Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow - Dove Cameron

Oh the weather outside is frightful, 
But the fire is so delightful, 
And since we've no place to go, 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 

It doesn't show signs of stopping, 
And I've bought some corn for popping, 
The lights are turned way down low, 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 

When we finally kiss goodnight, 
How I'll hate going out in the storm! 
But if you'll really hold me tight, 
All the way home I'll be warm. 

The fire is slowly dying, 
And the deer was still good-bying, 

But as long as you love me so, 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 

You know it's snowing, snowing, and snowing 
And I don't want it go 

When we finally kiss goodnight, 
How I'll hate going out in the storm! 
But if you'll really hold me tight, 
All the way home I'll be warm. 

Oh the weather outside is frightful, 
But the fire is so delightful, 
And since we've no place to go, 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 
Let it snow, snow, snow!
