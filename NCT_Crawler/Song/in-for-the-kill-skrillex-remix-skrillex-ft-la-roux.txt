                        We can fight our desires
Oooh but when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
Oooh whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust
Oooh but what is love without lust?
Two hearts with accurate devotions
Oooh and what are feelings without emotions?

Let’s go to war
To make peace
Let's be cold
To create heat

I’m going in for the kill
I’m doing it for a thrill
Oh I’m hoping you’ll understand
And not let go of my hand (and not let go of my [2x])

I had my hopes out on the line
Oooh they'd be ready for you in time
If you leave them out too long
Oooh they’ll be withered by the sun

Let’s go to war
To make peace
Let's be cold
To create heat

I’m going in for the kill
I’m doing it for a thrill
Oh I’m hoping you’ll understand
And not let go of my hand (and not let go of my [2x])
