I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light

Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathing, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light
Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathing, leave it all behind

I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
Light, light light light light light light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light..

Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathing, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light
Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathing, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light

Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathing, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light

I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
Light light light light light light light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light

I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light..
Even if it makes me blind..
Even if it makes me blind..
