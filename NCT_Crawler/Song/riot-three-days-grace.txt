                        Song: Riot - Three Days Grace

If you feel so empty
So used up, so let down
If you feel so angry
So ripped off so stepped on
You're not the only one
Refusing to back down
You're not the only one
So get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

If you feel so filthy
So dirty so *** up
If you feel so walked on
So painful so ***
You're not the only one
Refusing to go down
You're not the only one
So get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

If you feel so empty
So used up, so let down
If you feel so angry
Just get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
                        
                    |
