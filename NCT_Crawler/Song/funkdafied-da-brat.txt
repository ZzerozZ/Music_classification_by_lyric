 So let's take a ride with the Brat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat on that ass So, so, so funkdafied
 So, so, so funkdafied Open up, open up and let the funk flow in
 From this nigga named J and his new found friend
 I'm hittin' switches like Eric on the solo creep
 For yo jeep it's the B R A T Puttin' the dip in your hip from right to left
 It's that ghetto west bitch and I'm so, so Def
 Nigga, that's my click, nigga, that's who I rolls with
 And we kicks nothing but the fat *** Them calls me the funkdafied, funkalistic, vocalistic
 With the real ***, we got the *** you can't *** wit

 Because we so funkdafied
 (Why?)
 We make you move from side to side Well, it's the G H the E T T O, nigga
 Brat and J.D. comin' like that big baby

 And freak this duet just like Ashford and Simpson 'Cause I'm so, so, so funkdafied
 So, so, so funkdafied
 So, so, so funkdafied
 So, so, so funkdafied Puttin' it down, puttin' it down, ain't no thing to me
 And ain't too many hoes that can hang with me
 It's like that and as a matter of fact, when it comes to the Brat
 I got the *** that'll make your neck snap back Meaning I got the *** that a get'cha bent
 Tearin' the roof off this motha like Parliament
 I'm on a roll in control like Janet, damnit!
 (Ranch, oh, the funk bandit and they can't handle it) I know, that's why I keep hittin' 'em with this grammar
 Lettin' niggas know that I'm the real mama jama
 Straight to the head like a chronic sack
 I passed the mic to the Brat and yo I passed it back Wella sistas and fellas, it's time to get your groove on
 I provide the funkdafied sound to make you move on
 Breakin' these fools off proper like

 And since this ain't no honeymoon, I'm here to stay
 And the way we comin' at ya, baby, we can't miss
