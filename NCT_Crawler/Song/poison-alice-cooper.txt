                        Bài hát: Poison (Album Version) - Alice Cooper

Your cruel device,
Your blood like ice.
One look could kill,
My pain, your thrill.

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison runnin through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains.

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat

I hear you callin and it's needles and pins (and pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you, but you're under my skin (deep in)
I wanna kiss you, but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison runnin through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains
Poison

One look (one look), could kill (could kill),
My pain, your thrill.

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison runnin through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains
Poison

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I wanna too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison

Yeah
Well I don't wanna break these chains
Poison

Runnin deep inside my veins
Burnin deep inside my veins
Poison
I don't wanna break these chains
