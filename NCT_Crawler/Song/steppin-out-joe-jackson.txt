                        Now, the mist across the window hides the lines
 But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
 Electricity so fine
 Look and dry your eyes We, so tired of all the darkness in our lives
 With no more angry words to say can come alive
 Get into a car and drive to the other side
 (Me babe, steppin' out)
 Into the night, into the light
 You babe, steppin' out
 Into the night, into the light We are young but getting old before our time
 We'll leave the TV and the radio behind
 Don't you wonder what we'll find
 Steppin' out tonight You can dress in pink and blue just like a child
 And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
 We'll be there in just a while, if you follow me
 (Me babe, steppin' out)
 Into the night, into the light
 You babe, steppin' out
 Into the night, into the light Me babe, steppin' out
 Into the night, into the light
 You babe, steppin' out
 Into the night, into the light Me babe, steppin' out
 Into the night, into the light
                        
                    |
