                        Well, rock a-baby rock rock rock
 I just love the way you dance
 Rock a-baby rock rock rock
 Don't tell me that you can't
 Rock rock rock
 We're gonna rock the whole night long

 Well, you dance in here - you dance out there
 You powder your face and you comb your hair
 Oh rock - oh rock - oh rock - we gonna rock
 Gonna rock the whole night long

 Well, hit high on the floor - and hold my hand so tight
 I love you more and more - when you dance with all your might
 Ah rock rock rock - gonna rock the whole night long

 Put on your shoes and hit the floor
 I'm telling you again like I told you before
 Oh rock - oh rock - oh rock - yes rock
 Oh rock - yes rock - gonna rock the whole night long
