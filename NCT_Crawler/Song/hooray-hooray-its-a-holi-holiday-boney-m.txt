                        There's a place I know where we should go - heydiheydihoh 
won' t you take me there your lady fair - heydiheydihoh 
there's a brook near-by the grass grows high - heydiheydihoh 
where we both can hide side by side - heydiheydihoh 

Hooray! Hooray! It's A Holi-Holiday 
what a world of fun for everyone, holi-holiday 
Hooray! Hooray! It's A Holi-Holiday 
sing a summer song, skip along, holi-holiday 
it's a holi-holiday 

There's a country fair not far from there - heydiheydihoh 
on a carousel the dingdong bell - heydiheydihoh 
on the loop di loop we swing and swoop - heydiheydihoh 
and what else we'll do is up to you - heydiheydihoh 

Well, I'm game 
fun is the thing I'm after 
now let's a'live it up today 
get set for love and laughter 

Well, let's go 
time isn't here for wasting 
life is so full of sweet sweet things 
I'd like to do some tasting 

In the country side we take a ride - heydiheydihoh 
where the stars will shine lots of time - heydiheydihoh 
back of your old car we might get far - heydiheydihoh 
in the summerbreeze we feel at ease - heydiheydihoh
