                        Bài hát: Can't Raise A Man - K. Michelle

Listen,
He got older, but never grew,
For his life he can't tell the truth.
How to love he ain't got a clue,
Playing games like he'll never lose you.

Try to talk to him, can't get through,
Every day he's a different dude.
These are the signs of a grown ass boy,
Better run for the hills, I'm just trying to keep it real.

You can't raise a man, he's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he acts like a boy. If he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody, if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody.
'Cause you can't raise a man, no, no.

Coming home any time at night, expecting you to let it ride
How many tears are you gonna cry? Playing games like he'll never lose you
You know that the love is changed, how many times he called you out your name?
These are the signs of a grown ass boy,
Better run for the hills, I'm just keeping it real.

You can't raise a man, he's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he acts like a boy. If he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody, if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody.
You can't raise a man, no, no.

Gonna take more than a miracle to change him, just let him go.
Tell me when will you decide to do better with your life.
If his momma couldn't do it what makes you think
You can train a boy to be a man, it's too late.
Better off letting him go, no matter how hard you try you can't raise.

You can't raise a man, he's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he acts like a boy. If he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody, if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody.
'Cause you can't raise a man, no, no.
