                        It's a little cold outside tonight,
 but i was too close not to say, "Hi"
 You know i talked to a friend of yours at school
 She gave me the impression that you might be cool With a guy like me
 With a girl like you
 Oh, could you ever see
 A guy like me with a girl like you Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
 Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
 Am I a fool for fool for making you my whole world
 Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
 Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
 Please don't break it
 Please don't break it Cause all along it's been you on my mind
 Something special about you's
 Hard to find
 I know every girl's searching for romance
 And I'm wondering
 If you would take a chance
 On a guy like me with a girl like you
 Oh, could you ever see
 A guy like me with a girl like you
 Like you, like you! Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
 Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
 Am I a fool for fool for making you my whole world
 Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
 Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
 Please don't break it
 Please don't break it I'm a fool for you Cheyenne
 I'm a fool for you Cheyenne
 I'm a fool for you Cheyenne
 I ain't playing
 I just say it
 I can't live without you
 Ooh, ooh Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
 Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
 Am I a fool for fool for making you my whole world
 Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
 Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
 Please don't break it
 Please don't break it.
