                        I, I who have nothing
 I, I who have no one
 Adore you and want you so
 I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but, oh
 I love you He, he buys you diamonds
 Bright, sparkling diamonds
 But, believe me, dear, when I say
 That he can give you the world but he'll never love you the way
 I love you He can take you any place he wants
 To fancy clubs and restaurants
 But I can only watch you with
 My nose pressed up against the window pane I, I who have nothing
 I, I who have no one
 Must watch you go dancing by
 Wrapped in the arms of somebody else when, darling, it's I
 Who loves you I love you
 I love you
 I love you
                        
                    |
