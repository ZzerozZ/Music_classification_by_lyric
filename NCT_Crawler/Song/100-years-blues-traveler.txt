                        The sun is warm as the day is long
 I just got the feeling I can do no wrong
 I've got a long way to walk, can't afford my next meal
 I tell a few lies but my hunger is real And it won't mean a thing in a hundred years
 No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years Mademoiselle, tell me do you play?
 Well, if she shakes her head, well, then that's okay
 I watch her walk away in haste
 There's just no accounting for some people's taste And it won't mean a thing in a hundred years
 No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years Big angry man in the doorway there, yeah
 Just keep on walking like I don't care
 But why you're giving such an evil eye?
 Could it be you were ignored by every passerby? And it won't mean a thing in a hundred years
 No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years Play in the park for tobacco and food
 Then I excuse myself but they think I'm rude
 Tourist don't want me to end his show
 But this colorful attraction got places to go And it won't mean a thing in a hundred years, yeah
 No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years, oh Sit at the pier, watch the sun go down
 Another lost little boy in a big old town
 I want to laugh, I want to cry
 But no matter how hard I may try It won't mean a thing in a hundred years
 No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years
 No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years
