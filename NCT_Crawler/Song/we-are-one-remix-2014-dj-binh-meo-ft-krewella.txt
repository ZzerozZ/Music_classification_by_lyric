                        Bài hát: We Are One (Remix 2014) - DJ Bình Mèo, Krewella

I wanna go for a ride 
Until the morning comes
Show me the meaning tonight 
Of what we could become
I can't go any longer
Feels like I've been underwater
You are the one and I need the rush takin' over me
I crave you more than ever

We are one like the sky is to the stars
We are one take my breath and I am yours
We are one as you open up my heart
Running out of air

You are taking me there

There's no denying the power
'Cause something pulls us together
You are the one and I need the rush
Every part of me is free when I surrender

We are one like the sky is to the stars
We are one take my breath and I am yours
We are one as you open up my heart
Running out of air

You are taking me there
You are taking me there
You are taking me there
You are taking me there

You are taking me there

We are one like the sky is to the stars
We are one take my breath and I am yours
We are one as you open up my heart
Running out of air

You are taking me there
You are taking me there
You are taking me there
You are taking me there
                        
                    |
