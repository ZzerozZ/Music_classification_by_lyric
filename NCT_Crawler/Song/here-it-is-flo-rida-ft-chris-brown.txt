                        Bài hát: Here It Is - Flo Rida, Chris Brown

[Chorus - Chris Brown:]
If you're waiting for the moment, here it is
If you're aiming for the heart then you can't miss
You wanna know oh oh oh oh, where's the love
Here it is
Where's the love, where's the love
Here it is

Yeah I'm back like Thriller, get up
Ready for the build up
Sinner baby I'm no saint
I'm a stone cold winner, picture money where your mouth is
They can never break my bank
But the way you go, go now baby now you've got it
Turn around, you know that I want it
There's only really one thing that I gotta know-ow
Where in the world you're dropping it
I got the dollars and I'm ready to sponsor it
I got the guava with the cheese, no laundering
[?] collar stain killing my confidence

[Pre-Chorus:]
Give you that XO freebie
Let's go, repeat
Come and get some of this L-O-V-E
You know what I want, I know you need
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Let me tell you now

[Chorus]

Hey now I can tell
You the one I wanted from a mile away
Ain't nobody looking like you up in here
Good times written all over your face
Yeah cause the way you show
Show me, show out, show me all your talents
Whoa now, throw me all of balance
Ay good girl, I'm a real bad habit
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Ain't no debate I'm heaven sent
I'm bout to take you to the places you've never been
Keep you up all night, I'm Letterman
Sick with it, I'ma bring you the medicine

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

You wanna do it all day
I give you the Flo and I let you ride it baby
Good lovin' don't play, give me the show
Oh yeah I like the way you roll roll roll it
Keep the party going
There's really only one thing I gotta know-oh

[Chorus]
                        
                    |
