Title: I Know Him So Well
Artist: I Know Him So Well (Radio Edit)

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong

But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much for far too long.

Wasn't it good? Oh so good
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine?

But in the end he needs
A little bit more than before
She needs security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well.

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide.

Looking back I could have played it differently
Learn about the man before I fell
I was just a little careless
But I was ever so much younger then.
I was so much younger then
Now at least I know I know him well

Wasn't it good? Oh so good
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine
Isn't it madness he won't be mine?

Didn't I know how it would go?
If I knew from the start

Why am I falling apart?
Wasn't it good?
Wasn't he fine? Isn't it madness
He won't be mine?

But in the end he needs a little bit more than before
She needs security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
It took time to understand him

I know him so well.
