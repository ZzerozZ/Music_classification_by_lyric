Kanye West - Flashing Lights lyrics
(feat. Dwele)

She don't believe in shootin stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartement
Courtois from the store's departments
You more like love to start ***
I'm more of the, trips to Flor-i-da
Order the hors d'oeuvres, views of the waters
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather's so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror, dancin so sleazy
I get a call like "Where are you Yeezy?"
I try to hit you with the
Till I got flashed by the Papparazzi
Damn, these niggaz got me
I hate these niggaz more than a Nazi

As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know
What do I know

I know it's been a while sweetheart, we hardly talk
I was doin my thing
I know it was foul baby every day lately
You've been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Frontin though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'd go get this difficult
Feelin like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no VISA
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum, I'm just sayin
Hey Mona Lisa come home, you know you can't Rome without Ceasar

As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know
What do I know
As you recall you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
But what do you know
What do you know
