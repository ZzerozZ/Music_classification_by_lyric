Bop bop bop bop bopopopopopopop 

She was afraid to come out of the locker 
She was as nervous as she could be 
She was afraid to come out of the locker 
She was afraid that somebody would see 

Two three four tell the people what she wore 

It was an Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini 
That she wore for the first time today 
An Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini 
So in the locker, she wanted to stay 

Two three four stick around we'll tell you more 

Bop bop bop bop bopopopopopopop 

She was afraid to come out in the open (badadup) 
So a blanket around her she wore (badadup) 
She was afraid to come out in the open (badadup) 
So she sat, bundled up on the shore (badadup) 

Two three four tell the people what she wore 

It was an Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini 
That she wore for the first time today 
An Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini 
So in the blanket, she wanted to stay 

Two three four the stick around we'll tell you more 

Bop bop bop bop bopopopopopopop 

Now she's afraid to come out of the water 
And I wonder what she's gonna do 
Now she's afraid to come out of the water 
And the poor little girl's turning blue 

Two thee four tell the people what she wore 

It was an Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini 
That she wore for the first time today 
An Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini 
So in the water, she wanted to stay 

From the Locker to the blanket 
From the blanket to the shore 
From the shore to the water 
Guess there isn't any more
                        
                    |
