                        Bài hát: Stay The Night - James Blunt

It’s 72 degrees, zero chance for rain 
It’s been a perfect day 
We’re all spinning on our heels, so far away from real 
In California 
We watched the sunset from our car, we all took it in 
And by the time that it was dark, you and me had something, yeah! 
And if this is what we’ve got, then what we’ve got is gold 
We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know 
The morning’s on it’s way, our friends all say goodbye 
There’s nowhere else to go, I hope that you’ll stay the night 
We’ve been singing Billie Jean 
Mixin’ vodka with caffeine 
We’ve got strangers stopping by 
And though you’re out of tune 
Girl you blow my mind, you do 
And I’ll say I don’t wanna say good night 
There’s no quiet corner to get to know each other 
And there’s no hurry I’m a patient man 
As you’ll discover 
Cause if this is what we’ve got, then what we’ve got is gold 
We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know 
The morning’s on it’s way, our friends all say goodbye 
There’s nowhere else to go, I hope that you’ll stay the night 
Just like the song on our radio set 
We’ll share the shelter of my single bed 
But it’s a different tune that’s stuck in my head 
And it goes... 
If this is what we’ve got, then what we’ve got is gold 
We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know 
The morning’s on it’s way, our friends all say goodbye 
There’s nowhere else to go, I hope that you’ll stay the night...
