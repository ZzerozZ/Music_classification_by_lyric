I wanna live I wanna give

Em C D C 
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.

Em C D G 
It's these expressions I never give

Em G 
That keep me searchin for a heart of gold

And I'm gettin old. 

Em G 
That keep me searchin for a heart of gold

And I'm gettin old. 


I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a Heart of Gold
And I'm getting old.

You keep me searchin and I'm growin old

D Em 
Keep me searchin for a heart of gold
