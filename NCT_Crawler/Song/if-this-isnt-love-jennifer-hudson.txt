                        I'm calling his phone up just to tell him how much
 I really love him 'cause he's everything I want
 He listens to me, cares for me so I truly believe

 God sent me an angel from above
 That's gonna love me for life
 Might as well be perfect only because
 It's the only way I can describe, so

 If this isn't love, tell me what it is
 'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
 If this isn't love, tell me what it is
 'Cause I never felt like this baby
 If this isn't love

 L O V E, what is in me?
 L O V E, oh, if this isn't love
 L O V E, what is in me?
 L O V E, oh, if this isn't love

 I'm selfish 'cause I don't wanna share him with nobody
 Not even those people that came before me
 But see, I never believed

 God would send me an angel up from above
 That's gonna love me for life
 Might as well be perfect only because
 It's the only way I can describe, so

 If this isn't love, tell me what it is
 'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
 If this isn't love, tell me what it is
 'Cause I never felt like this baby
 If this isn't love

 L O V E, what is in me?
 L O V E, oh, if this isn't love
 L O V E, what is in me?
 L O V E, oh

 So if you got real love
 Lemme see you put your hands up
 See you put your hands up
 The kind of love that fits quite like a glove

 Lemme see you put your hands up
 See you put your hands up
 If this isn't love

 'Cause I know I ain't crazy
 I know I ain't tripping
 I know I ain't slipping
 I know that it's love

 You see me with my hands up
 If you think I'm dreaming
 I know I ain't dreaming
 'Cause this is the reason I love him because
 If this isn't love

 If this isn't love, tell me what it is
 'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
 If this isn't love, tell me what it is
 'Cause I never felt like this baby

 L O V E, what is in me?
 L O V E, oh, if this isn't love
 L O V E, what is in me?
 L O V E, oh, if this isn't love

 Love, L O V E
 Love, L O V E
