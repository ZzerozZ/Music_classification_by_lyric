                        [ti:the way you move]
[ar:outkast & sleepy brown]
[al:]
[offset:500]
Boom, Boom, Boom.
Heh, Heh.

[Big Boi]
Ready for action, nip it in the butt.
We never relaxin’, OutKast is everlastin’
Not clashin’, not at all but see my nigga went to do a little acting.
Now that’s for anyone askin’ give me one pass em’
Drip drip drop there goes an eargasm
Now you cumin out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks (Thanks!)
So flickle the tickle lets see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin’ like two midgets in the back seat wrasling
Speakerbox vibrate the tank, make it sound like aluminum cans in the back.
But I know ya’ll wanted that 808 can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass
But I know ya’ll wanted that 808 can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass

[Chorus]
I like the waaaay you move
I like the waaaay you move (Whoo-o-o!)
I love the waaaay you move
I love the way, I love the way.

I love the waaaay you move
I love the waaaay you move (Whoo-o-o!)
I love the waaaay you move
I love the way, I love the way.

[Big Boi]
Then the whole room fell silent (Shhhhh!)
The girls all pause with glee, turning left turning right hardly looking at me,
But I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now they got me in the middle feeling like a man ***
Specially the big girl, big girls need love too no discrimination in this world.
So keep your hands off my cheeks, and let me study how you ride the beat
You big freak!
Skinny, slim women got the ghetto within them
You can *** them, lift them, bend them, give them something to remember
Hail out timber when you fall through the chop shop.
Take a deep a breath and exhale your ex male friend, boyfriend was boring as hell
Now let me listen to the stories you tell and we can make moves like a person in jail.
On the loco

[Chorus]
I like the waaaay you move
I like the waaaay you move (Whoo-o-o!)
I love the waaaay you move
I love the way, I love the way.

I love the waaaay you move
I love the waaaay you move (Whoo-o-o!)
I love the waaaay you move
I love the way, I love the way.

[Sleepy Brown]
Heeeey baby, girl don’t you stop
Come on baby dance on the top of me
You so fine (you so fine) you so fine
You drive me outta my mind (my mind, outta my mind!) Oooh baby!
If I could I would, just be with yoooou baaaaby
Ooooooh Cause you like me and excite me and you know you gotta leave baby!
Oooooo!

I like the waaay you move (I like the way you move)
I like the waaay you move (Ooo you so sexy baaby!) (Whoo-o-o!)
I love the waaay you move
I love the way, I love the way (Whoo-o-o!)

I love the waaay you move (I love the way you move)
I love the waaay you move (Ooo you so sexy baaby!) (Whoo-o-o)
I love the waaay you move
I love the way, I love the way.

I like the waaay you move
I like the waaay you move (Whoo-o-o!)
I love the waaay you move
I love the way, I love the way.

I love the waaay you move
I love the waaay you move (Whoo-o-o!)
I love the waaay you move
I love the way, I love the way
