                        It's your voice in my ear
 It's your perfume in the air
 It's your smile and your laugh
 It's the greatest feelin' that I've ever had I'm into you, girl
 I get more confident each time you call my name
 I'm into you, you, girl
 I guess I must admit I'm finally tuned in
 I'm into you, you, girl From your hair to your toes
 You're like sunshine to my soul
 Every move that you make
 Tastes like candy to my brain And I'm so in love with you
 And I'm hopin' you love me too
 And I'm havin' such a lovely time
 I get so excited girl, you blow my mind I'm into you, girl
 I get more confident each time you call my name
 I'm into you, you, girl
 I guess I must admit I'm finally tuned in
 I'm into you I got something for you
 And I hope you think it's good
 I gotta a plan on pickin' you up
 And givin' you all my love I wanna give you everything
 Whatever you want I'll do, yeah
 'Cause I'm shakin'
 Girl, I'm makin', I just can't take it I'm so into you, you, girl
 I get more confident each time you call my name
 I'm into you, you, girl
 I guess I must admit I'm finally tuned in
 I'm into you, you, girl I got no self defense, I'm helpless
 You can have your way

 I wanna give you everything and I will do what you say I'm into you, girl
