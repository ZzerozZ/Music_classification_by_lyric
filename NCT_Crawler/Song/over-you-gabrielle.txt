                        From the moment that we met
 I knew that we would connect
 Your eyes had told me that
 Somehow we shared a history Feeling fearless I took a chance
 Couldn't let the moment pass
 I felt that fate had played a hand
 And brought you here to me But happiness can be short lived
 (It can be short lived)
 And pain can bring you to your knees Don't think that I'll get over you
 Don't know if I can make it through
 My darkest days without you in my life
 And I don't think that I can face the pain
 I'll never see your face again
 (I close my eyes and wonder when)
 Will it ever end Got as close as we could be
 Felt that you could see through me
 You read my mind, you knew my life
 Became a part of me Took for granted precious times
 Thought we had it on our side
 (By some cruel twist of fate)
 I had to watch you fade away (Don't think)
 That I'll get over you
 Don't know if I can make it through
 My darkest days without you in my life
 And I don't think if I can face the pain
 I'll never see your face again
 (I close my eyes and wonder when)
 Will it ever end Don't think that I'll get over you
 Don't know if I can make it through
 My darkest days without you in my life
 (Don't think)
 If I can face the pain
 I'll never see your face again
 (I close my eyes and wonder when)
 Will it ever end (Don't think)
 That I'll get over you
 Don't know if I can make it through
 My darkest days without you in my life
 (And don't think)
 If I can face the pain
 I'll never see your face again
 (I close my eyes and wonder when)
 Will it ever end Don't think, don't know
 (Will it ever end, will it ever end)
 Don't think
 (Will it ever end)
