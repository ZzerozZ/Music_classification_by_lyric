                        If you were worried 'bout where
 I been or who I saw or
 What club I went to with my homies
 Baby don't worry you know that you got me If you were worried 'bout where
 I been or who I saw or
 What club I went to with my homies
 Baby don't worry you know that you got me Somebody told me that this planet was small
 We use to live in the same building on the same floor
 And never met before
 Until I'm overseas on tour
 And peep this Ethiopian queen from Philly
 Taking classes abroad
 She studying film and photo flash focus record
 Said she workin on a flick and
 Could my click do the score
 She said she loved my show in Paris
 At Elysee Montmartre
 And that I stepped off the stage
 And took a piece of her heart
 We knew from the start that
 Things fall apart, intentions shatter
 She like that *** don't matter
 When I get home get at her
 Through letter, phone, whatever
 Let's link, let's get together
 *** you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot
 Time passed, we back in Philly now she up in my spot
 Tellin me the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
 Startin buildin with her constantly round the clock
 Now she in my world like hip-hop
 And keep tellin me If you were worried 'bout where
 I been or who I saw or
 What club I went to with my homies
 Baby don't worry you know that you got me If you were worried 'bout where
 I been or who I saw or
 What club I went to with my homies
 Baby don't worry you know that you got me Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin a flight
 And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
 And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol
 Another lonely night
 Seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
 I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that *** tight
 But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
 While politicin with my sister from New York City
 She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
 Psych, I'm playin boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin boo
 And when cats be poppin game I don't hear what they sayin boo
 When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
 With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
 So when you sweatin on stage think of me when you rhyme
 And don't be listenin to your homies they be leavin you blind Yeah, so what you sayin I can trust you?
 Is you crazy, you my king for real
 But sometimes relationships get ill
 No doubt If you were worried 'bout where
 I been or who I saw or
 What club I went to with my homies
 Baby don't worry you know that you got me If you were worried 'bout where
 I been or who I saw or
 What club I went to with my homies
 Baby don't worry you know that you got me That snake could be that chick
 And that rat could be that cool cat
 That's whispering "she tryin to play you for the fool Black"
 If something's on your chest then let it be known
 See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
 And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
 That people bite back and fracture what's intact
 And they'll forever be I ain't on some "oh I'm a celebrity"
 I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be
 I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
 Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
 That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
 Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, she like
