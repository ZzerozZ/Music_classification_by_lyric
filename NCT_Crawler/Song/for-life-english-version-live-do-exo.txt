                        Bài hát: For Life (English Version) (Live) - D.O. (EXO)

This life has twist and turns
But it's the sweetest mystery
When you're with me
We say a thousand words
But no one else is listening
I will be

Every night and every day
No matter what may come our way
We're in this thing together
The dark turns to light
We both come alive, tonight
I'm talking bout forever

Never gonna let you go
Giving you my heart and soul
I'll be right here with you for life
Oh, baby all I wanna do
Is spend my every second with you
So look in my eyes
I'll be by your side

The storms may come
And winds may blow
I'll be your shelter for life
This love, this love
I mean it till the day I die

Oh, never gonna let you go
Giving you my heart and soul
I'll be right here with you for life
Oh, baby all I wanna do
Is spend my every second with you
So look in my eyes
I'll be by your side

Yeah, look in my eyes
I'll be by your side
For life
                        
                    |
