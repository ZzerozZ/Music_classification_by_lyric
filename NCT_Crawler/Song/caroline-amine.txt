[Verse]
Bad thang, fine as hell, thick as ***
Oh my god, that's my baby
Caroline, you divine
Mighty fine
Shawty really blow the pipe (that's true)
Like a pro
Aha, *** you thought?
Holy ***, I'm really lit
It's looking like it's 'bout time to *** it up
Caroline, listen up, don't wanna hear
About ya horoscope or what the future holds
Shut up and shut up and
Let's get gory, like a Tarantino movie
Don't wanna talk it out, can we *** it out?
Cause we gon' be up all night, *** a decaf
You say I'm a tall thug, guess I'm a G-raffe
If ya want safe-sex, baby use the knee pads
Freaky with the sticky icky
Baby give me kitty kitty
Killa, westside nigga
Boy you like 98 degrees
And I'm 300, nigga keep ya feet runnin'
I chief keef keef when I eat these beats
Better boy get scurred
Don't run up in my lane, I don't want you in my lane
You a lame, get swerved

[Chorus]
Cause great scenes might be great
But I love your bloopers
And perfect's for the urgent

I want you to be my

Aha... what?
Holy ***, I'm really lit
It's looking like it's 'bout time to *** it up

Shut up and shut up and
Let's get gory, like a Tarantino movie
Don't wanna talk it out, can we *** it out?

Baby give me kitty kitty
Killa, westside nigga
Boy you like 98 degrees
And I'm 300, nigga keep ya feet runnin'
I chief keef keef when I eat these beats
Bet a boy get scurred
Don't run up in my lane, I don't want you in my lane
You a lame, get swerved

[Chorus]
Cause great scenes might be great
But I love your bloopers
And perfect's for the urgent
Baby I want forever
Caroline, don't you see that
I want you to be my
