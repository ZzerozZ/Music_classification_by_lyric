                        When the scene unfolds
 Young girls thirteen years old
 Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
 Got mo' stretch marks than these hoes
 Hollin' they got rank
 See Sega ain't in this new world order
 Dem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
 United Nations, overseas
 Trained assassins to do search and seize Ain't knocking or asking
 Dem coming for niggas like me
 Po' white trash, like they
 Tricks like her back in slavery
 Concentration camps lace with gas pipes lines
 Inferno's outdoors like they had back
 When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
 Listen to me now, believe me
 Later on in the future look it up Where they say it? Ain't no more constitution
 In the event of a race war
 Places like operation Heartbreak Hotel
 Moments tear until air tight vents seat off despair
 Dem say expect no mercy
 Foot you should be my least worries got to deal with
 Where my W-2's, 1099's
 Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
 And try to put missiles in mines Who's that peeking in my window
 Pow, nobody now
 Who's that peeking in my window
 Pow, nobody now Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
 A gate with the serial code was put up next
 The claim that this community is so drug free
 But it don't look that way to me 'cuz I can see
 The young bloods hanging out at the sto 24/7
 Junkies looking for a hit of the blo', it's powerful Oh, you know what else they tryin' to do
 Make a curfew especially for me and you
 The traces of the new world order
 Time is getting shorter if we don't get prepared
 People it's gone be a slaughter
 My mind won't allow me to not be curious
 My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
 But every now and then, I wonder
 If the gate was put up to keep crime out or to keep our ass in Who's that peeking in my window
 Pow, nobody now
 Who's that peeking in my window
 Pow, nobody now Listen up little niggaz I'm talking to you
 About what yo little ass need to be going through
 I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
 But I do with the crew everybody on the average 'bout 4 or 5
 I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise now I realize the cost
 After I lost my best friend Bean I recognize as a King
 Who am I to tell you to stop smokin'
 Now you're open to disease and colds
 And ain't 16 years old, this *** has got to stop
 Let's take a walk through detox I want outta this hold, I'm in a cell under attack
 Loc up folks they in the hood, got an eye on every move
 I make open your face to info you ain't know
 'Cuz it's kept low how the new world plan
 Reeks the planet without the black man
 So what's your angle, try to separate me from the blood
 Is disrespect like coming in my home and not
 Wiping your feet on tha rug
 The Citron Absolut has got me bucking no hang with no phony
 Lookout for the man with tha mask and the white pony On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels
 Insane, plain, soldiers coming in the dark by plane
 To enforce the new system by reign
 Tag my skin with your computer chip
 Run your hand over tha scanner to buy you dish now
 No more fishing for your fish
 Kiss tha days of tha old days past ways gone
 Mind blown, conception, protection
 My name on your selections but I caught you coming, pow Who's that peeking in my window
 Pow, nobody now
 Who's that peeking in my window
 Pow, nobody now Who's that peeking in my window
 Pow, nobody now
 Who's that peeking in my window
 Pow, nobody now
