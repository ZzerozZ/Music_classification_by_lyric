                        Bài hát : Sight Of The Sun - Fun.

For once there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up

The city outside still sounds like it’s on fire
You put on new sheets
The white flag of a Saturday night
I know we stayed up talking in circles
But I like to think the symmetry
Will keep me close to you
For everyone, I’m out to pull wrong, you keep the light on
The only one, you now me better than the truth
So despite what I’ve done I pray to God that we can move on
Cause thus far you are the best thing that this life is yet to lose

And, for once there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up
I lay here waiting for you to wake up

So if you gonna leave, if you gonna go
I can’t bare to sleep without you in my arms
I know we got caught up slipping through a crowd of people and losers
But you must not let them take you
They don’t know you like I do

For once there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up
I lay here waiting for you to wake up

Do you remember when we stayed up till the sun stretched through the room
I used to blame it on the queens walking down 7th Avenue
It’s been years now since we moved
I’ve gotten through with an excuse
You know I try not to speak superlatives
But it’s imṗossible to you

The city outside is nothing but a flicker now
You see our friends to bed, you turn out the lights
I start to think you’ll make a beautiful mother, I
I like to think I have everything I want from this life.
