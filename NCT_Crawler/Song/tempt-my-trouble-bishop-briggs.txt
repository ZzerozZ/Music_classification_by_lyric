                        Bài hát: Tempt My Trouble - Bishop Briggs

Why you got it in for me
Is it cause I bring it to your knees
Throw water on electricity
Just to see if the sparkle make us feel
The way we used to feel
You're my heart-taker
I'm your heart-breaker
And we're both fakers
Faking always trade it to each other's arms
We know where we are
We know where we are

Unchain my ghoul
But don't you ever let me go

Lights go out again
You stroke my pain
And tempt my trouble
Seek how we pretend
But we're not friends
And we're not lovers
We're just trouble
We're just trouble
So tempt my trouble

I keep on messing with your head
You keep on messing up my bed
I feel like we're two stoners, two loners
Who keep on forgetting everything they've said

Unchain my ghoul
But don't you ever let me go

Lights go out again (lights go out again)
You stroke my pain
And tempt my trouble
Seek how we pretend (how we pretend)
But we're not friends
And we're not lovers
We're just trouble
We're just trouble
So tempt my trouble

So why you gotta tempt my trouble?
So why you gotta tempt my trouble?
Oh

Lights go out again (lights go out)
You stroke my pain
And tempt my trouble (temp my trouble)
Seek how we pretend (seek how we pretend)
But we're not friends
And we're not lovers (we're not lovers)
We're just trouble
We're just trouble
So tempt my trouble
We're just trouble
We're just trouble
So tempt my trouble
