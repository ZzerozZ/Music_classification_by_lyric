                        From the cradle to the grave
 Life ain't never been easy living in the ghetto
 From the cradle to the grave
 Life ain't never been easy June 16, 1971, mama gave birth
 To a hell raisin' heavenly son
 See the doctor tried to smack me
 But I smacked him back My first words were
 "Thug for life" and "Papa pass the Mac"
 I'm bustin' on these motha***as ballin'
 Listen you can hear my mini 14 callin' From out the window of my drop top
 I got my glock cocked
 Bustin' at niggas when will it stop?
 Now tell me are you scared of the dark? Can't close my eyes I see visions
 And even with this thug livin', will I escape prison ?
 Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
 The only way to advance and if you slang Better have your Nikes on 'cause when we fight
 It's in the middle of the night with no lights on
 Hey, there must be a God 'cause I feel lucky
 Paranoid out my mind, this motha***a's tryin' to rush me Am I goin' to jail? Look at me bailin'
 Commin' out the court house all about my mail and bank
 Never die, be a hustler motha***as and makin' thugs out you suckas
 From the cradle to the grave From the cradle to the grave
 Life ain't never been easy, living in the ghetto From the cradle to the grave, since a little bitty child
 I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild
 Pop, pop, just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
 Go runnin' up the block in the dark with less spark Surveillance on a nigga every day
 Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away
 Now Mama always workin', tryin' to make ends meet
 So now a young niggas bein' raised by the streets And then the only other one that ever showed me love
 Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
 A straight thug, just me, my mama out here on our own
 So I got two gatts, one black and one of chrome Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine
 It's all the *** I got, so stop and walk a thin line
 Young niggas be brave and keep on thuggin'
 From the cradle to the grave, from the cradle to the grave From the cradle to the grave
 Life ain't never been easy, living in the ghetto From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say
 I made it this far, many G's died hard
 They know that got was their name here up on a wall
 It's sad thinkin' about the times Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land
 As the war zone I got no home
 Don't have no friends neither
 It's just me by my lonely so I married my Nina I keeps her wherever I go, I love my ho
 Never leave home with out my sugar
 I'm hafta plug a nigga
 Mama told me not to trust no punks And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me
 Since then I been known
 Sometimes I think my own self stupid
 'Cause I stay shootin' at marks
 Get twisted up in police reports Since the cradle, I've been ungrateful
 My first toy was a gun
 I got sprung and learn to love weapons But now I'm through with money
 And through with street fame
 Somebody peeled my cap
 And put me in my grave From the cradle to the grave
 Life ain't never been easy, living in the ghetto
 From the cradle to the grave
 Life ain't never been easy, living in the ghetto March 18th, that rainy day, my mama gave birth
 To a baby boy, trapped in hell on earth
 From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb
 Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum I tried to cope loc but my family's broke
 And my pocket's short so now I gotta sling dope
 In a game filled with pain, it's a ***in' shame
 The white man got a motha***a slingin' cane So now it's on from dusk to dawn I get my serve on
 Always in the spot with my glock slingin' rocks at the rocks
 The *** don't stop I'm steady dodgin' cops
 I never flip flop, hear my glock cock thug till I drop And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
 Sittin' on my bunk reminiscing about the good times
 It's ***ed up a nigga gotta grow up doing dirt
 But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work From the cradle to the grave
 Life ain't never been easy, living in the ghetto
 From the cradle to the grave
 Life ain't never been easy, living in the ghetto Time's movin' fast, will I last another day?
 So I pray and I lay with my A-K
 Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
 All the things I did wishin' someone held me
 But they never did I can't take it, will I make it to my older age?
 Before I'm shot up or locked up in a ***in' cage
 Lord, help me, guide me, save me
 'Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me crazy Do or die, nigga, pull the trigger don't give a ***
 You'd rather be in jail than get your ass bucked
 Nobody cares, it's me against the world
 Keepin' murder on my mind and my Tech-9 I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga you wanna die?
 I get high then my mission is a walk-by
 You'd better jet when I hit your set 'cause I'm commin'
 Start runnin', yellin', "Evil mind", as I'm gunnin' One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside
 For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died
 The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave
 So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave From the cradle to the grave
 Life ain't never been easy, living in the ghetto
 From the cradle to the grave
 Life ain't never been easy, living in the ghetto
