                        {Death be not proud
 Though some have called thee mighty and dreadful
 Art not so} Yeao Yeao
 We lost the war, I'm feelin' to win
 Though I never tried to strive deep from within
 Life could be beautiful for anybody it's for
 But I'd swear this motherfuckin' *** is rotten to the core The portal has been past and it's time to make a turn
 To follow the reaper until the point of no return Yeao When your blindly death rayin' blade
 Sweeps the griefs and tears away
 I cross my heart and hope to die
 Thy freedom will be mine Sinkin' down in the ocean of severe emotions
 Grab a bottle to drink up the pain relievin' potion
 But after all, that got boring too
 So no matter what happens, I couldn't give a damn too Wow The portal has been past till the point of no return
 No more lines to cross, no bridges to burn Now Now when your blindly death rayin' blade
 Swept my griefs and tears away
 I'd never go back to cross that line
 I cross my heart and hope
 To die {I was only twenty one when I died}
