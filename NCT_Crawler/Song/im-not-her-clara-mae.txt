                        Bài hát: I'm Not Her - Clara Mae

[Verse 1]
Been two years, our memories are blurred
Hadn't heard your voice, no, not a word
But still they, they talk about the things we were
They talk about us
But I don't know the things that you have heard

[Pre-Chorus]
She's dancing on your feet
With our song on repeat
She painted every role of us
She's taking off her clothes
In the bed you kept me warm
Heard she's everything I never was

[Chorus]
No, I'm not her, no, never will
Never gonna move like her, move like
I'm not her, no, never will
Never gonna look like her, be like
I'm not her, I'm not her (no)
At least that's what I've heard

[Verse 2]
Me, myself, just stumble under glue
The thing I thought was missing wasn't you
And now I'm no longer scared to meet the night
I'm doing alright
Me, myself, we started something new
                        
                    |
