                        I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
Oh, to find a better day

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
Oh, to find a better day

Sometimes, some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes, you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run
But now I truly realize
Some people don't wanna compromise
Well I saw them with my own eyes
Spreading those lies, yeah

Well I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say lady

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
Oh, to find a better day

Well I'm so tired baby
Of things you say
You're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room baby
Don't listen to the games they play
Girl I thought you'd realized
I'm not like them other guys
Cuz I saw them with my own eyes
You should've been more wise babe

Well I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say lady

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
Oh, to find a better day
