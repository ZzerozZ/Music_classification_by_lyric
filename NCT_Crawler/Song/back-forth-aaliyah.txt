                        [x5]
 Let me see you go back
 Let me see you go forth

 It's Friday
 And I'm ready to swing pick up my girls
 And hit the party scene
 Tonight oh oh it's alright umm
 So get up and let this funky mellow groove get
 You in the mood cause you
 Know it's alright
 (back round - so Mr. Dj keep the music grooving
 Don't stop moving
 Let me see you, let me see you go

 Back, back forth and forth [x4]
 (see you go back and forth)

 Now it's time for you
 To make your move to the dance floor
 So throw your hands in the air
 And wave them around like you just don't care
 Ya oh it's the liyah
 Living up to the stage I got jazz personality,
 G mentality peace to soul train
 So if the dj keep on moving
 Don't stop moving know let me hear you go
 Back and forth

 Personality be who you wanna be now tell me
