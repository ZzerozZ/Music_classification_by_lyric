                        I turn on the tube and what do I see
 A whole lotta people cryin' "Don't blame me"
 They point their crooked little fingers at everbody else
 Spend all their time feelin' sorry for themselves
 Victim of this, victim of that
 Your momma's too thin; your daddy's too fat

 Get over it
 Get over it
 All this whinin' and cryin' and pitchin' a fit
 Get over it, get over it

 You say you haven't been the same since you had your little crash
 But you might feel better if they gave you some cash
 The more I think about it, Old Billy was right
 Let's kill all the lawyers - kill 'em tonight
 You don't want to work; you want to live like a king
 But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing

 Get over it
 Get over it
 If you don't want to play, then you might as well split
 Get over it, get over it

 It's like going to confession every time I hear you speak
 You're makin' the most of your losin' streak
 Some call it sick, but I call it weak

 You drag it around like a ball and chain
 You wallow in the guilt; you wallow in the pain
 You wave it like a flag, you wear it like a crown
 Got your mind in the gutter, bringin' everybody down
 Complain about the present and blame it on the past
 I'd like to find your inner child and kick it's little ass

 Get over it
 Get over it
 All this bitchin' and moanin' and pitchin' a fit
 Get over it, get over it

 Get over it
 Get over it
 It's gotta stop sometime, so why don't you quit
 Get over it, get over it

 Get over it
