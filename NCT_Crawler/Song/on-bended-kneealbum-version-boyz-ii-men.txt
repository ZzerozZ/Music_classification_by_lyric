                        Darlin' I can't explain
 Where did we lose our way
 Girl it's drivin' me insane
 And I know I just need one more chance
 To prove my love to you
 If you come back to me
 I'll guarantee
 That I'll never let you go

 Can we go back to the days our love was strong
 Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
 Can somebody tell me how to get things back
 The way they use to be
 Oh God give me a reason
 I'm down on bended knee
 I'll never walk again until you come back to me
 I'm down on bended knee

 So many nights I dream of you
 Holding my pillow tight
 I know that I don't need to be alone
 When I open up my eyes
 To face reality
 Every moment without you
 It seems like eternity
 I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

 Can we go back to the days our love was strong
 Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
 Can somebody tell me how to get things back
 The way they use to be
 Oh God give me a reason
 I'm down on bended knee
 I'll never walk again until you come back to me
 I'm down on bended knee

 Gonna swallow my pride
 Say I'm sorry
 Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
 I want a new life
 And I want it with you
 If you feel the same
 Don't ever let it go
 You gotta believe in the spirit of love
 It can heal all things
 We won't hurt any more
 No I don't believe our love's terminal
 I'm down on my knees begging you please
 Come home

 Can we go back to the days our love was strong
 Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
 Can somebody tell me how to get things back
 The way they use to be
 Oh God give me a reason
 I'm down on bended knee
 I'll never walk again until you come back to me
 I'm down on bended knee

 Wanna build a new life
 Just you and me
 Gonna make you my wife
 Raise a family
