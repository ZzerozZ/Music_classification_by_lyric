                        Song: Cheating - John Newman

I saw you Sunday, Monday
Hanging with your man again
You came back on a Tuesday
With that cold-heart look of shame

Oh I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
'Cause cheating's just a thing you do
It's just a thing you do

I saw you Friday, Saturday
Tearing up another heart
You came home a' crying
Why'd you take it all so hard?

You know I love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
But I would never cheat on you

Yeah, I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
'Cause cheating's just the thing you do
It's just a thing you do, yeah

Ohhh
I've been told you baby
Girl you done some things so bad to me
And I know

[X2]
You are the one that's creeping,
You are the one that's cheating,
But if your heart is beating,
Bring it on, bring it to me.

[X2]
You are the one that's creeping
You are the one that's cheating
But if your heart is beating
Bring it on, bring it to me.

I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
But I would never cheat on you, no.

I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
'Cause cheating's just a thing you do
oh no no no
