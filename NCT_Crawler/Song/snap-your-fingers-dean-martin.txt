                        (Snap your fingers)
 And I'll come running
 (Back to you)
 On bended knees Snap your fingers
 I will come running
 I'll be true
 Take a chance on me Let your light turn green
 Baby, I got to know
 Give me some kind of clue
 Should I stay or go? Let me love you like a lover
 That you used to know
 Turn the key and let me in
 To the same old door
 (That same old door) I had it, but lost it
 Now, I got a broken heart to mend
 I don't care what the cost is
 Got to find a way back in So, snap your fingers
 Baby, I'll come running
 I'll do anything
 To get back again
 (Get back again) I don't care what the cost is
 Got to find a way back in So, snap your fingers
 Baby, I'll come running
 I'll do anything
 To get back again
 To come back again
 (To come back again)
