                        Get your party gown
 Get your pigtail down
 Get your heart beatin baby
 Got your timin right
 Got your act all tight
 Its gotta be tonight my little
 Schoolbabe

 Your momma says you don't
 And your daddy says you wont
 And I'm boilin up inside
 Aint no way I'm gonna lose out this time

 Tie your mother down
 Tie your mother down
 Lock your daddy out of doors
 I don't need him nosing around
 Tie your mother down
 Tie your mother down
 Give me all your love tonight

 Youre such a dirty louse
 Go get outta my house
 That's all I ever get from your
 Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
 A single little civil word from those guys
 But you know I don't give a light
 I'm gonna make out all right
 I've got a sweetheart hand
 To put a stop to all that
 Grousin an snipin

 Tie your mother down
 Tie your mother down
 Take your little brother swimmin
 With a brick (that's all right)
 Tie your mother down,
 Tie your mother down
 Or you aint no friend of mine

 Your momma and your daddy gonna
 Plague me til I die
 Why can't they understand I'm just a
 Peace lovin guy
 Tie your mother down
 Tie your mother down. .. Etc etc. ..
