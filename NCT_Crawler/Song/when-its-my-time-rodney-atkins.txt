                        Song: When It'S My Time - Rodney Atkins

I was late for work, had to pull to the side
 While a funeral train of cars drove by with their lights on
 It was just my luck, it went on and on for miles I kept checkin' my watch, grittin' my teeth
 Then suddenly it dawned on me that whoever this is
 Is gonna be missed for a long, long time
 It got me thinking When it's my time to go, the end of my road I hope it looks like this
 200 cars stretched out as far as the hearts I touched while I lived
 And I hope I leave half as much love behind when it's my time So I followed that last car down to the church
 Took off my ball cap, tucked in my shirt
 I just had to see what kind of life could cause such as traffic jam Heard story after story, people laugh, people cry
 It didn't take long to understand why every pew was full
 There's a lot of good souls made better for knowing him
 And now I'm one of them When it's my time to go, the end of my road I hope it looks like this
 200 cars stretched out as far as the hearts I touched while I lived
 And I hope I leave half as much love behind when it's my time Felt a hand on my back, turned around, someone asked
 "Did you know him well?"
 And I said, "Yeah, well enough to know" When it's my time to go, the end of my road I hope it looks like this
 200 cars stretched out as far as the hearts I touched while I lived
 And I hope I leave half as much love behind when it's my time
 Ooh, when it's my time
