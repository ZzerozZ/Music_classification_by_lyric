                        Bài hát: Pale Grass Blue - Enya

A silver hue on wings of blue
As all around me shadows dance in light
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay

And everywhere the blues
Are moving in the air
I see them in their flight
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay

For seven days
They make the sky
Look down upon them
As they go their way
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay

For seven nights
They wait the moment
For the morning light to come again
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay

And one by one
They wander one by one
Meander never go astray
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay

And so I stand and gaze
And so I watch the maze of blues depart the day
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay

Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
                        
                    |
