                        Bài hát : My Oh My - Aqua

[Chorus]

1. Little princess in a terrible mess
A kingdom alone, but no love to confess
Dreams of a prince on a tall white horse
Runs like a spirit by the castle walls

Gotta steal from the rich when they don't know I'm comin'
Gotta give to the poor, no time for lovin'
My oh my, don't you cry, 'cause there's no way I'm stayin'
I will leave, say "bye bye", I'm going my way.

[Chorus:]
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To have the Kingdom, baby, tell me why
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To rule the Country, baby, you and I?

If you were my King, I would be your queen
If you were my King, I would be your queen.

2. Mystery deep in the royal heart
Crying at night, I wanna be apart
Prince, oh prince, are you really sincere
My Oh My lyrics on ***
Bet you one day you're gonna disappear.

Gotta steal from the rich when they don't know I'm comin'
Gotta give to the poor, no time for lovin'
My oh my, don't you cry, 'cause there's no way I'm stayin'
I will leave, say "bye bye", I'm going my way...

[Bridge:]
My oh my, ohh
My oh my, ohh
My oh my, ohh
My oh my...
