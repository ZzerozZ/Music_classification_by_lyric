                        Bài hát: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together - Taylor Swift

I remember when we broke up the first time 
Saying this is it, I've had enough, 'cause like 
We haven't seen each other in a month 
When you, said you, needed space, what? 
Then you come around again and say 
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change 
Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day 
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you 

Oooh we called it off again last night 
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you 
We are never ever ever getting back together 
We are never ever ever getting back together 
You go talk to your friends talk 
To my friends talk to me 
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together 

Like ever... 

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights 
And me, falling for a screaming that I'm right 
And you, will hide away and find your piece of mind with some indie record that's much cooler than mine 

Oooh you called me up again tonight 
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you 
We are never ever ever getting back together 
We are never ever ever getting back together 
You go talk to your friends talk 
To my friends talk to me 
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together 

I used to think, that we, were forever ever ever 
And I used to say never say never 
Huh, he calls me up and he's like, I still love you 
And i'm like, i'm just, I mean this is exhausting, you know 
We are never getting back together, like ever 

We are never ever ever getting back together 
We are never ever ever getting back together 
You go talk to your friends talk 
To my friends talk to me 
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together 

We, oooh, oooh, not back together, we 
Oh, getting back together 

You go talk to your friends talk 
And my friends talk to me 
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
