                        If you're alone
I want you to know
I'll be back someday

If you're alone
I want you to know
I'll be back someday

It's time for me to have to go
Away for so long
To make our own paradise
But dreams don't come easy you've gotta believe me
You know this deep inside

But it's not long now
'Till I'm on my way
I keep wishing tomorrow was yesterday
You're my everything
That won't disappear
Girl you've got nothing to fear

Chorus:
If you're alone, I want you to know I'll be back someday
Don't you ever let go
Baby, hold tight through the cold lonely night
Just wait for me 'till I get home
When you're on your own
I want you to know
I'll be there for you, I could never let go
I realise that you want me to stay
But hold on
I'll be back someday Be back someday, someday.

When I return, I wanna see
This beautiful baby who's still loving me
With tears in her eyes but a smile on her face
Impatiently we'll embrace

But it's not long now
'Till I'm on my way
I keep praying tomorrow was yesterday
You're my everything that won't disappear
Girl you've got nothing to fear

Chorus...

And when I go, I'll be loving you still
Baby you will never know, just how lonely I'll feel
You know I really gotta go, but I wish I could stay
Hold on, just hold on, I'll be back
I'll be back

Chorus...
                        
                    |
