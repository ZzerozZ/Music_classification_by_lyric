                        Ooh, it's a crazy world
 Ooh, it's a crazy world

 I get up in the morning
 For my dose of the news
 Crawl right back in the sack girl
 Had enough of the truth
 Spend your dollars and rubles
 Buy a piece of the wall
 Build it up in your backyard
 I'm so sick of it all

 Ooh, it's a crazy world
 Ooh, it's a crazy world

 Driving down to the city
 Doing 155
 Better late than never
 I'm more dead than alive
 We can find the Titanic
 Put a man on the moon
 But we can't fix out backyard
 Man we better start soon

 Ooh, it's a crazy world
 Ooh, it's a crazy world
 Ooh, it's a crazy world
 Ooh, it's a crazy world

 I don't want to hear about it
 I wish it would be worlds away
 You know the more I think about it
 The more I feel we need to change

 I get up (In a crazy, crazy world)
 We all live (In a crazy, crazy world)
 Ooh (It's a crazy, crazy world)
 Got to get out (Of this crazy, crazy world)

 Going home to my baby
 It's been another hard day
 Bust my balls for the tax man
 So what else can I say
 They spent our money on missiles
 For the Third World War
 Now they're stacked in my backyard
 We don't need them no more

 Ooh, it's a crazy world
 Ooh, it's a crazy world
 Ooh, it's a crazy world
 Ooh, it's a crazy world
