                        Bài hát: Mind Of A Stoner - MGK, Wiz Khalifa

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ok, I lost my job last night
Picked up my paycheck
But 35% of it's gone already cause Uncle Sam ain't get paid yet
Mom and them bitchin bout this rent
I ain't even gon' say ***
And half of what is left goes to her
(Why?) Cause I ain't use that latex, damn
Cheese sandwich and chips (meal)
Slim just spilled his drink in my Toyota 96 (wheels)
Well at least that blunt is lit
Don't they say life is what you make it?
Then I'm tryna make it money
And ride through my hood clean as Easter Sunday, that's wassup, uh

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
One time
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
One time
For the bull*** that you came from
Worked hard to get away from
But the devils there and you just can't seem to shake em
Two times
For them long nights that you stayed up
Thinkin about that paper
Crush it, lick it, split it, light it, blaze up
From the mind of a stoner, from the mind of a stoner
Simple thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner
Just the mind of a stoner, the mind of a stoner
Simpler thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner, oh

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Parents aren't doin much now since little brother got locked up
And I'm stuck smokin this mid waiting for the weed man to get stocked up
And my girl cancelled on me, said something else popped up
And I can't get with my ex now cause her ring finger all rocked up, damn,
No one likes you when your 23 without a plan
Sit around in apartments all day smokin weed and I'm like
"Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe"
Till I (skkrrrrrrttt) out in my Subaru and in the rear view is them lights
I'm talking about red white and blue
The same color as our flag
The one's that they say salute
But the ones that's whoopin my ass
And the same days that I'm happy
Is the same days that I'm mad
Cause I can't go 24 hours without *** happening to my ass, get high

[Hook]

[Outro: talking - Machine Gun Kelly]
Rollin up this weed
Thinkin about life
And you know what?
I'm good, yeah!
