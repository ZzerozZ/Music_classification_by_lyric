Westlife-When You Come Around

The day I was leaving
I was feeling insecure
I thought that I'd thrown away
All of those days
And what we had before
And now I believe it
After what you had to say
I thought about every day
In every way
And this is what I'll say now baby

You don't have to worry
Cause everything's all right
I know that you'll get me
That you'll get me through the night

When you come around
You know you pick me up when I'm feeling down
And I want you to know
Baby how can I show
Do I have to scream and shout
When you come around
You only have to smile and you knock me out
But I'm here on the floor
And I'm begging for more
Baby that's what love's about

There's so many reasons
Why our love is guaranteed
So many reasons why
I can't hide
Just what you mean to me
So say what you're thinking
While you're sitting next to me
Let all your feelings show
Just let me know
Just how it's meant to be now baby

You don't have to worry
Cause everything's all right
I know that you'll get me
That you'll get me through the night

When you come around
You know you pick me up when I'm feeling down
And I want you to know
Baby how can I show
Do I have to scream and shout
When you come around
You only have to smile and you knock me out
But I'm here on the floor
And I'm begging for more
Baby that's what love's about

You don't have to worry
Cause everything's all right
I know that you'll get me
That you'll get me through the night

When you come around
You know you pick me up when I'm feeling down
And I want you to know
Baby how can I show
Do I have to scream and shout
When you come around
You only have to smile and you knock me out
But I'm here on the floor
And I'm begging for more
Baby that's what love's about
