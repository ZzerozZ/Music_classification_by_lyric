                        Bài hát : If I Could Change Your Mind - Haim

[Verse:]
No, please don't cry
I've never done this before, drove a million miles
Back, when you were mine
I was too young to know you were the one to find

[Bridge:]
But if I was to say I regret it
Would it mean a thing?
Cause every time I think (I think) think about it
Memories take me back to all of the wildest times

[Chorus:]
If I could change your mind
I would hit the ground running
It took time to realize
And I never saw it coming
Forgive my lying eyes
Gonna give you all or nothing
If I could change your mind
I could make you mine, make you mine

[Verse:]
Now I won't go
I won't run away this time
But all I wanna know

[Bridge:]
But if I was to say I'll forget it
Would it mean a thing?
Cause every time I think (I think) about it
Memories take me back to all of the wildest times

[Chorus]

[Verse:]
Visions of our love pass right by me
Your eyes are enough to remind me
Visions of our love pass right by me
Your eyes are enough to remind me
Visions of our love remind me

[Chorus]

Visions of our love remind me
(If could change your mind)
Visions of our love remind me
(It took time to realize)
Visions of our love remind me
(Forgive my lying eyes)
Visions of our love remind me
(If I could change your mind, I could make you mine...)
                        
                    |
