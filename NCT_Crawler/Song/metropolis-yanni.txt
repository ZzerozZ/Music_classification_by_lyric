                        The smile of dawn
Arrived early May
She carried a gift from her
home
The night shed a tear
To tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain
She'll never outgrow

Death is the first dance, eternal

There's no more freedom
The both of you will be
confined to this mind

I was told there's miracle for
each day that I try
I was told there's a new love
that's born for each one that
has died
I was told there'd be no one to
call on when I feel alone and
afraid
I was told if you dream of the
next world
You'll find yourself swimming
in a lake of fire

As a child, I thought I could
live without pain without
sorrow
As a man I've found it's all
caught up with me
I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid

Somewhere like a scene from a
memory
There's a picture worth a
thousand words
Eluding stares from faces
before me
It hides away and will never be
heard of again

Deceit is the second without end

The city's cold blood teaches us
to survive
Just keep my heart in your eyes
and we'll stay alive

The third arrives...

Before the leaves have fallen
Before we lock the doors
There must be the third and
last dance
This one will last forever
Metropolis watches and
thoughtfully smiles
She's taken you to your home

It can only take place
When the struggle between
our children has ended
Now the Miracle and the
Sleeper know that the third
is love

Love is the Dance of Eternity
