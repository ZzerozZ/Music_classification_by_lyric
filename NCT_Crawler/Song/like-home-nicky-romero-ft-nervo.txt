                        Bài hát: Like Home - Nicky Romero, Nervo

Love the way they all keep talking 
Everybody likes the sound 
But no one ever hears me crying, crying out. 

I think you're saying what you mean now 
I feel it when you take me close 
Something's telling me that I should let you know. 

You make it feel like home 
You make it feel like home 
Like home.

Never been so scared of losing 
But never understood the calm 
So take me where I wanna be back in your arms. 

Cause you make it feel like home 
You make it feel like home 
Like home. 

Only you only you only do this 
Only you only you only do this 
And it's never the same cause. 

You make it feel like home 
You make it feel like home.
