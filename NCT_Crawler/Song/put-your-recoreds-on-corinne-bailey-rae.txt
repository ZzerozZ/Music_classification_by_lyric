                        Three little birds, sat on my window. 
And they told me I don't need to worry. 
Summer came like cinnamon 
So sweet, 
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete. 

Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's alright 
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same 
Oh, don't you hesitate. 

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song 
You go ahead, let your hair down 
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams, 
Just go ahead, let your hair down. 

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow. 

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely, 
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside, 
(just relax, just relax) 
Don't you let those other boys fool you, 
Got to love that afro hair do. 

Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's alright 
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change. 
Don't you think it's strange? 

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song 
You go ahead, let your hair down 
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams, 
Just go ahead, let your hair down. 

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow. 

'Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake 
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger 
When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer? 
Do what you want to. 

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song 
You go ahead, let your hair down 
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams, 
Just go ahead, let your hair down. 

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song 
You go ahead, let your hair down 
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams, 
Just go ahead, let your hair down. 

Oh, you're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
