                        We seduce the dark with pain and rapture
 Like two ships that pass in the night
 You and I, a *** and a bashful sailor
 Welcome to a sunrise of a dirty mind

 All you love is a lie
 You one-night butterfly
 Hurt me, be the one
 Whoever brings the night

 The Dark, created to hide the innocent white, the lust of night
 Eyes so bright, seductive lies
 Crimson masquerade where I merely played my part
 Poison dart of desire

 All you love is a lie
 You one-night butterfly
 Hurt me, be the one
 Whoever brings the night

 Choose a bride
 Tonight a fantasy for a zombie
 Hurt me, I love to suffer
 Your harem's a dream for free

 Enter
 Suck from us and live forever
 Rotten beauty
 Will haunt you for a lifetime

 Come with me underwater
 And drown to despise me no more
 Unholy, unworthy
 My night is a dream for free

 All you love is a lie
 You one-night butterfly
 Hurt me, be the one
 Whoever brings the night
                        
                    |
