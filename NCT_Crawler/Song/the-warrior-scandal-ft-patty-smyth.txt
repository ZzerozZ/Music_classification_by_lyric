                        You run, run, runaway
 It's your heart that you betray
 Feeding on your hungry eyes
 I bet you're not so civilized Well isn't love primitive?
 A wild gift that you wanna give
 Break out of captivity
 And follow me a stereo jungle child
 Love is the kill, your heart's still wild Shooting at the walls of heartache
 Bang, bang, I am the warrior
 Well, I am the warrior
 And heart to heart you'll win
 If you survive the warrior, the warrior You talk, talk, talk to me
 Your eyes touch me physically
 Stay with me we'll take the night
 As passion takes another bite, oh Who's the hunter, who's the game?
 I feel the beat call your name
 I hold you close in victory
 I don't wanna tame your animal style
 You won't be caged in the call of the wild Shooting at the walls of heartache
 Bang, bang, I am the warrior
 Well, I am the warrior
 And heart to heart you'll win
 If you survive the warrior, the warrior
 I am the warrior Shooting at the walls of heartache
 A warrior, I am the warrior
 And heart to heart you'll win
 Heart to heart you'll win
 If you survive the warrior, the warrior Shooting at the walls of heartache
 Bang, bang, I am the warrior
 Yes, I am the warrior
 Victory is mine Shooting at the walls of heartache
 The warrior, I am the warrior
 Shooting at the walls of heartache
 Bang, bang, I am the warrior
