                        Just in time
 I found you just in time
 Before you came my time
 Was running low

 I was lost
 The losing dice were tossed
 My bridges all were crossed
 Nowhere to go

 Now you're here
 And now I know just where I'm going
 No more doubt or fear
 I've found my way

 For love came just in time
 You found me just in time
 And changed my lonely life
 That lovely day

 Now you're here
 And now I know just where I'm going
 No more doubt or fear
 'Cause I've found my way

 For love came just in time
 You found me just in time
 And changed my
 Lonely life that lovely
 Lonely life that lovely
 Lonely life that lovely day
                        
                    |
