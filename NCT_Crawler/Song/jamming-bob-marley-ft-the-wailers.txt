 We're jammin'
 I want to jam it with you
 We're jammin', jammin'
 And I hope you like jammin' too
 Ain't no rules, ain't no vow

 Cause every day we pay the price
 With a little sacrifice
 Jammin' till the jam is through We're jammin'
 To think that jammin' was a thing of the past
 We're jammin'
 And I hope this jam is gonna last
 No bullet can stop us now
 We neither beg nor we won't bow
 Neither can be bought nor sold
 We all defend the right
 Jah Jah children must unite
 For life is worth much more than gold We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jammin'
 And we're jammin' in the name of the Lord
 We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jammin'

 The truth cannot hide
 To keep you satisfied
