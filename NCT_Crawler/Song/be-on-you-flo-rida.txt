I said excuse me little mama if I may 
Take this thought and send it your way 
And if you don’t like that, then send it right back, 
But I just gotta say 
I wanna be on you (on you) 
I wanna be on you (on you) 
And if you don’t like that, then send it right back 
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say 

Flo Rida 
Hey, shawty with no limits, that’s what I need all the time, 
I’m wit with with it, she with it, she not sure she put it down 
Come get get get it, the business, I hi hit it, whose is it 
The Benz with the windows tinted, oh I get dirty south 

Showning, like them grown men, goose patrongen 
Let let me go in, sexy moanin, ca catch me jonesin 
Let no not ever with this lil mama off schedule 
Got me achy, call me papi, hottest I be fly as feathers 
But but bout that, sh shawty housed that

I wanna pop it like ecstasy, pretty face and all that 
But what I look for, this gal is hood core 
But that is outdoors 
Deserve an encore, the definition of a shone

Flo Rida 
Hey, I’m feeling you girl, wanna get close to you, no doubt 
My sister swagger should tell it more 
than anything can vouch 
Little mama you are what’s inside ghetto 
Fine I’ll make you proud 
So stuntalicious, I love it, lets at least work something out 
Miss thing, million dollar game, coke bottle frame 
Make my wall of fame let me know your name 
I control the rain I could make it better, matter of fact 
I make it weather, stormy weather with this cheddar 
All because you hot as ever 
if you may lady, let me play baby, make my way baby, 
You won’t like it, send it back and its okay baby 
You’s a keeper, touch of diva, give me a fever 
If I could freak ya, give me the word and I’ll be along
