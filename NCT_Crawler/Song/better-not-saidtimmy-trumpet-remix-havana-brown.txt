                        [Verse 1]
 Don't you reach for the wave if you can't ride it, ride it
 Don't be jumping off my grid, if you can't drive it, drive it
 If you wanna play my trick, the trigger light it, light it
 Say you want a bad bitch, then I buy it

 All alone, let it go
 Something's better not said
 How you came to me like a rolling thunder
 Take you there

 I wanna feel my eyes rolled to the back of my head
 And my heart beat pump pump pump
 I wanna feel your love take me over the head
 Got my body screaming one more round round round

 All alone, let it go
 All alone, let it go
 And it feels like

 [Instrumental]

 [Verse 2]
 Ride my engine hot hot in the traffic, traffic
 You don't need that green light to get me at it, at it
 If you wanna crop my body, make me criminal
 If you want a bad bitch, drop me wonderful

 All alone, let it go
 Something's better not said
 How you came to me like a rolling thunder
 Take you there
 I wanna feel my eyes rolled to the back of my head
 And my heart beat pump pump pump
 I wanna feel your love take me over the head
 Got my body screaming one more round round round
 I wanna feel my eyes rolled to the back of my head
 And my heart beat pump pump pump
 I wanna feel your love take me over the head
 Got my body screaming one more round round round

 All alone let it go
 All alone let it go
 And it feels like!

 [Instrumental]

 And it feels like
 And it feels like
 And it feels like

 [Instrumental]
