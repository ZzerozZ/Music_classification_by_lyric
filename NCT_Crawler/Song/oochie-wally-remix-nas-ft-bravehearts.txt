                        Oh yeah mutha***a that's that ***
 Oh come on Ladies make it hot
 Thugs make it hot make it pop [Chorus]
 Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
 Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
 Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
 Oo-chie wally wally
 He really really really work my body
 He really really really turned me out
 He really really really got to gut me
 He really really made me scream and shout He really taught really me how to work my body
 He really taught me how to go down south
 He really really tried to hurt me hurt me
 I really love his thug and gangsta style Yo we got chicks in the living room
 Getting it on and they ain't leaving till 6 in the morning
 "O" is for oochie
 Oh you ain't know
 How many O's in the bankroll
 Sort of like like the game show
 "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"
 But my name ain't Regis
 Nas the one they call
 When they want there thing beat up
 Honeys' with bodies
 With Bravehearts guns in the party
 Waves, braids, baldies
 Trademarks to army
 Is that Horse it must be
 I heard he husky
 Yeah, there go Jungle eyes red
 Looking for trouble
 And that's Nas dancing with dimes
 But who's his manage
 The imperial thug
 Is cold deep grand wiz
 We taking honeys' to the crib tonight
 Guarantee we gon' get up in they rib tonight
 Check the new slang
 It's changed the braveheart gang bang
 When you see me pass
 Holla oochie bang bang [Chorus] Yeah what up ma
 Take a look, you hypnotized
 On how my long dick stretch your insides
 For real ma, with your thick lips and thick thighs
 Stoke both holes, pass it to Nas
 Or pass it to Naish, or pass it to Jung
 Or pass it to Horse, then that ass gettin tossed
 *** a hustler book, penthouse or blacktale
 I got bitches sendin my niggas flicks in jail
 I *** a bitch face more than her waist for real
 And ain't no pussy like new pussy thats how a nigga feel
 Bust three times throw her the peace sign
 She sleep then my dick sleek and I ain't gotta call her for weeks
 Long leg hoes, mo'head hoes, married bitches
 Me and my dog, ***in them both they got us switchin
 Is the nigga gangsta? Yeah, that's how I'm livin
 That's how I'm playin, I got these freak ***in hoes singin [Chorus] Little young thing go around my dick with your tongue ring
 Deep throat my nine inch, gut from the front and
 Grind from the side and, *** from behind and
 Grab her hair slap her ass, she screamin' like she dyin'
 Make her come four times without even tryin
 I'll beat that pussy up there's no denyin
 Hit her where she doodie at, make that booty fat
 Little cutie rat, walking by with the doobie wrap
 Tight blue jeans, air max
 Small gucci bag
 No loot and no job
 Stay home giving blow jobs
 Like no prob, it's simple
 Holla out the window it's the project nympho
 *** my whole crew, you know how we do
 You got that good pussy I can share with my peoples
 Be a brave girl, do your thang
 Let them tities hang, I'll have all the bitches sayin [Chorus] When it comes to sex I'm similar to the thriller in manilla
 Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
 I'll *** a big boned or slim chick
 Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
 Ain't no sleepin in my bedroom
 When henny's in my dick
 When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
 Deep throat, Caesar gold or pun wicked hoes
 Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
 I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
 Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
 Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
 Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
 Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on
 Sippin Perignon with Kelly Price on
 I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
 Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
 Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
 Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
 Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
 Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
 Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
 Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
 Oo-chie wally wally
