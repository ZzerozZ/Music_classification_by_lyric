                        Bài hát: Precious Love - James Morrison

I was so lost, didnt know what to do with myself 
I was my own worst enemy 
I was lost and know I needed help Then you came along and saw the state I was in 
You picked me up, when I was down 
Showed me how to live again I say thank you for pulling me through 
Im a lucky man 
I didnt know what life was but now I understand This is precious love, precious love 
No, I cant let it go 
This is precious love and its teaching me 
Everything I need to know This is precious love, oh its precious love 
No, I cant get enough 
Oh, Im down on my knees, begging you please 
Give me some more of that stuff Oh, its love, love, love, love, love, precious love 
Oh, its love, love, love, love, love, precious love Oh, I got so distracted by people all around 
Whispering sweet nothings 
Filling my head with doubt So I gave up, it didnt take long 
For me to see the one thing that I was missing 
Was standing in front of me I took you for granted, thought the grass 
Was greener on the other side 
I was wrong and its taken so long for me to finally realize This is precious love, precious love 
No, I cant let it go 
This is precious love and its teaching me 
Everything I need to know Oh this precious love, oh its precious love 
No, I cant get enough 
Oh, Im down on my knees, begging you please 
To give me some more of that stuff I say a prayer and send it to you 
That my heart will always be true 
Life wont be the same without you So I say thank you 
Im a lucky man 
I didnt know what life was but now I, now I understand 
Understand, understand Oh, this is love, love, love, love, precious love 
This is precious love and its teaching me to be a better man This is precious love, precious love 
No, I cant get enough 
Oh, Im down of my knees 
Its there that I see, it must be from heaven above Yeah, its is love, love, love, love, precious love 
Its is love, love, love, love, precious love 
Love, love, love, give me love, give me love 
Love, love, love, love, precious love
