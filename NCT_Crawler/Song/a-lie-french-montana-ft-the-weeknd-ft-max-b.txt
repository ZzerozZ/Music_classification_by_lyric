                        Bài hát: A Lie - French Montana, The Weeknd, Max B

Uh, ball star ***
(Coke Boy, baby)
Thought I'd have a little fun with it
Montana, Montana, ow
You know what it is when you're hearin' that, haan
Yep, we gon' get it in, baby
(La música de Harry Fraud)
Oh, yeah, baby, yeah
You bring it back in, skrrt, skrrt

Shawty in the way, got the mothafuckin' fix, yeah
Sippin' all day got me leanin' off the kickstand
House on my neck, 'nother house on my wristband
Girls really love me like a mothafuckin' six pack
No time for restin' (restin')
My life's a mess, ended up bein' a fuckin' legend (legend)
An icon, tryna cement it ('ment it)
I'm treatin' every year like it's game 7 (game 7)
I feel like problems in my city been deaded (deaded)
I feel like me and my niggas are unthreatened (threatened)
My new girl hate it when I'm always spendin' (all the time)
I guess I gotta get used to it 'cause my exes
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)
I'm in the cold, rep the north like I'm Trudeau (yeah)
Yeah it's true, though (true, though)
Yeah it's true, though (true, though)
My heart cold but it really beat for you, though

Ooh, he do it better, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)
He at my level, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)
A hundred thousand for the times, yeah
They fuckin' with us, that's a lie, ooh, yeah
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (skrrt, skrrt)
All of my homies gonna shine (gonna shine)
You fuckin' with us, that's a lie (yeah)

It's true, though (it's true, though)
It, it's true, though (it's true, though)
I hope your box don't spread like the rumors
Sad, but it's true, though (it's true, though)
It's true, though (it's true, though)
We was bite down, now we true'd up (a lie)
She, she say the baby mine's, that's a lie (that's a lie)
If I ain't the hottest in the city, that's a lie (that's a lie)
School, teach you how to read the lines (read the lines)
In these streets, gotta read between the lines
Room, room full of ether clouds, you don't want no smoke
'Fore, 'fore I choke, baby, I'ma choke 'em from their choker (yeah)
Only the red in my eyes see where you come from
We, we the gang, either you run with or run from
I, I'm the head, rockin' bet it's re-up in the sock
Me and Max hit the block like Karl Malone, Stockton
And if I ain't the new Chapo, that's a lie (that's a lie)
And if he try and tell you we gon' stop, that's a lie

Ooh, he do it better, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)
He at my level, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)
A hundred thousand for the times, yeah
They fuckin' with us, that's a lie, ooh, yeah
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie
All of my homies gonna shine (gonna shine)
You fuckin' with us, that's a lie (yeah)

I got me a little cheese baby, so come and play
Daddy'll pay the cab, maybe stay for a day
Knowin' I got it made
Bitches, they call me ***, son, more buns
Mami bent over for hum
Give her, what she want and let her get it good
Put it on her tongue
Told me, "Tell me, boy, you gotta get
Fix me with a lot of dick
Hit me with a lot of kick
Show me you the man"
Bustin' quickies and dippin'
That be somethin' I can't stand
Other plans, baby, had to leave
Tried to put me in a twirl like the Cheerio
I ain't talkin' cereal
Put me in your video, I can make a wave
Baby girl, comin' home and you can't stay, out

Ooh, he do it better, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)
He at my level, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)
A hundred thousand for the times, yeah
They fuckin' with us, that's a lie, ooh, yeah
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (skrrt, skrrt)
All of my homies gonna shine (gonna shine)
You fuckin' with us, that's a lie
