                        Song: Hallelujah
 Artist: Susan Boyle
I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, 
and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, 
and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, 
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, 
Hallelujah

Maybe I have been here before
I know this room, 
I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
Hallelujah, 
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, 
Hallelujah
