                        Hey little babe you're changing
 Babe, are you feeling sore?
 Ain't no use in pretending
 You don't wanna play no more

 It's plain that you ain't no baby
 What would your mother say
 You're all dressed up like a lady
 How come you behave this way

 Sail Away Sweet Sister
 Sail across the sea
 Maybe you find somebody
 Who loves you half as much as me
 My heart is always with you
 No matter what you do
 Sail away sweet sister
 Always be in love with you

 Forgive me for what I told you
 My heart makes a fool of me
 You know I'll never hold you
 I know that you gotta be free

 Sail Away Sweet Sister
 Sail across the sea
 Maybe you find somebody
 Who loves you half as much as me
 Take it the way you want it
 But when they let you down my friend
 Sail away sweet sister
 Back to my arms again

 Hot child don't you know, you're young -
 You've got your whole life ahead of you
 Oohah - You can throw it away too soon
 Way too soon
