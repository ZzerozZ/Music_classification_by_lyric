                        Song: C'est La Vie - B*Witched

Some people say I look like me dad
What?! Are you serious?

Ah Ohh Hey Hey [X2]
I said, hey boy sittin in your tree 
Mummy always wants you to come for tea 
Don't be shy, straighten up your tie 
Get down from your tree house sittin in the sky 
I wanna know just what to do 
Is it very big is there room for two ? 
I got a house with windows and doors 
I'll show you mine if you show me yours 

Gotta let me in, hey, hey, hey 
Let the fun begin hey 
I'm the wolf today hey, hey, hey 
I'll huff I'll puff 
I'll huff I'll puff and blow you away 

Say you will say you won't 
Say you'll do what I don't 
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie 

Do you play with the girls, play with the boys ? 
Do you ever get lonely playing with your toys ? 
We can talk, we can sing 
I'll be the queen and you'll be the king 
Hey boy in your tree 
Throw down your ladder make a room for me 
I got a house with windows and doors 
I'll show you mine if you show me yours 

Gotta let me in, hey, hey, hey 
Let the fun begin hey 
I'm the wolf today hey, hey, hey 
I'll huff I'll puff 
I'll huff I'll puff and blow you away 

Say you will say you won't 
Say you'll do what I don't 
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie 

Say you will say you won't 
Say you'll do what I don't 
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie
                        
                    |
