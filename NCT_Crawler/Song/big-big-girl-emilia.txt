                        i'm a big big girl 

In a big big world 

It's not a big big thing if you leave me 

But I do do feel 

 That I do do will

miss you much 

Miss you much... 

I can see the first it's falling 

It's all yellow and nice 

It's so very cold outside 

Like the way I'm feeling inside 

I'm a big big girl 

In a big big world 

It's not a big big thing if you leave me 

But I do do feel 

That I do do will 

miss you much 

Miss you much... 

Outside it's now raining 

And tears are falling from my eyes 

Why did it have to happen 

Why did it all have to end 

I'm a big big girl 

In a big big world 

It's not a big big thing if you leave me 

But I do do feel 

That I do do will 

miss you much 

Miss you much... 

I have your arms around me ooooh like fire 

But when I open my eyes 

You're gone... 

I'm a big big girl 

In a big big world 

It's not a big big thing if you leave me 

But I do do feel

That I do do will 

miss you much 

Miss you much... 

I'm a big big girl 

In a big big world 

It's not a big big thing if you leave me 

But I do feel I will miss you much 

Miss you much...
