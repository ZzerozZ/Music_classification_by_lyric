                        Please release me, let me go
 For I don't love you anymore
 To waste our lives would be a sin
 Release me and let me love again Oh I, I have found a new love, dear
 And I, I will always want her near
 Her lips are warm while yours are cold
 Release me, my darlin', let me go Please release me, let me go
 For I don't love you anymore
 To waste my life would be a sin
 So release me and let me love again Please release me, can't you see?
 You'd be a fool to cling to me
 To live a lie would bring us pain
 So release me and let me love again
 Let me go, let me go
                        
                    |
