                        Bài hát: Start Of Time - Gabrielle Aplin

Oh today I'm just a drop of water
And I'm running down a mountainside
Come tomorrow I'll be in the ocean
I'll be rising with the morning tide

There's a ghost upon the moor tonight
Now it's in our house
When you walked into the room just then
It's like the sun came out

I'm an atom in a sea of nothing
Looking for another to combine
Maybe we could be the start of something
Be together at the start of time

There's a ghost upon the moor tonight
Now it's in our house
When you walked into the room just then
It's like the sun came out
It's like the sun came out

And the day is clear
My voice is just a whisper
Louder than the screams you hear
It's like the sun came out
                        
                    |
