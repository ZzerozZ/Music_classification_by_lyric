                        Here you come again
 Just when I'm about to get myself together
 You waltz right in the door, just like you've done before
 And wrap my heart 'round your little finger Here you come again
 Just when I'm about to make it work without you
 You look into my eyes and light those dreamy eyes
 And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt you All you gotta do is smile that smile
 And there go all my defenses
 Just leave it up to you and in a little while
 You're messin' up my mind an' fillin' up my senses Here you come again
 Lookin' better than a body has a right to
 An' shakin' me up so, that all I really know
 Is here you come again an' here I go All you gotta do is smile that smile
 And there go all my defenses
 Just leave it up to you and in a little while
 You're messin' up my mind an' fillin' up my senses Here you come again
 Lookin' better than a body has a right to
 An' shakin' me up so, that all I really know
 Is here you come again an' here I go Here I go
 An' here I go
 An' here I go Here you come again
 An' here I go
 Here I go
 An' here I go
