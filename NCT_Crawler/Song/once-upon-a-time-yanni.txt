[00:-0.50]SMASHING PUMPKINS LYRICS - Once Upon A Time

Mother I'm tired
Come surrender my son
Time has ravaged on my soul
No plans to leave but still I go
Fallin' with the leaves
Fallin' out of sleep
To the last goodbyes
Who cares why?
Mother I've tried
Wasting my life
I haven't given up, I lie
To make you so proud in my eyes
Fallin' out of sleep
Crawlin' over me
To the last goodbyes
Who cares why?
Tuesdays come and gone
Restless i still drive
Try to leave it all behind
Fallin', fallin' out of sleep
Fallin', fallin' with the leaves
I go crawlin', crawlin' over me
Once upon a time in my life...
I went falling...
Mother I hope you know
That I miss you so
Time has ravaged on my soul
To wipe a mothers tears grown cold
                        
                    |
