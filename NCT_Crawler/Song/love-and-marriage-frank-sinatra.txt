                        Love and marriage, love and marriage
 Go together like a horse and carriage
 This I tell you brother
 You can't have one without the other Love and marriage, love and marriage
 It's an institute you can't disparage
 Ask the local gentry
 And they will say it's elementary Try, try, try to separate them
 It's an illusion
 Try, try, try, and you will only come
 To this conclusion Love and marriage, love and marriage
 Go together like a horse and carriage
 Dad was told by mother
 You can't have one, you can't have none
 You can't have one without the other Try, try, try to separate them
 It's an illusion
 Try, try, try, and you will only come
 To this conclusion Love and marriage, love and marriage
 Go together like a horse and carriage
 Dad was told by mother
 You can't have one (you can't have none)
 You can't have one without the other
