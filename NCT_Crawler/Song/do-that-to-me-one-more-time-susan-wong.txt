                        Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you
Whoa-oh-oh, kiss me like you just did
Oh, baby, do that to me once again

Pass that by me one more time
Once is never enough for my heart to hear
Whoa-oh-oh, tell it to me one more time
I can never hear enough while I got'ya near
Whoa-oh-oh, say those words again that you just did
Oh, baby tell it to me once again

Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Whoa-oh-oh, do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you
Whoa-oh-oh, kiss me like you just did
Oh, baby do that to me once again

Whoa-oh-oh, baby, do that to me once again
Whoa-oh-ho-oh-oh-oh, baby,
do that to me one more time
(Do it again) One more time
(Do it again) One more time
(Do it again) One more time
(Do it again) One more time
