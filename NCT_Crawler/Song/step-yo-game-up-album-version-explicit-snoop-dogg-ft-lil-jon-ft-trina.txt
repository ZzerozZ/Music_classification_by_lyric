 Shake till it ache, work that birthday cake
 You say you wanna make it ho

 Lookin' for a nigga that will suck me like a blow pop
 Run that dick to the door, do me baby don't stop
 Same nigga talkin' all that ***
 Just a little bitch, little balls, little dick
 Let me show you how to work your tongue like a hurricane
 We ain't here to play no games, baby give me everything I know you like me when I drop it down low
 Show it from the back, look back, let it roll
 Drop it to the floor like a G-bitch supposed to
 Shake it, shake it, shake it make a nigga go postal
 But that's for *** with a Miami girl
 Get your man, take his money, and then buy the world
 So nigga don't front
 'Cuz fat wallets and big dicks is all I want What you lookin' at
