 See this platinum thing right here?
 Well we're doing it all the time
 So you'd better get some better beats
 And uh, get some better rhymes
 We got the gang set so don't complain yet
 Twenty-four seven never begging for a raincheck
 Old school soldiers passing up the hot ***
 That rock *** and bounce in the mosh pit Throw your hands up
