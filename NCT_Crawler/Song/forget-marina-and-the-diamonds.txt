                        Bài hát: Forget - Marina and the Diamonds

Sometimes I think I’m not that strong
But there’s a force that carries me on
Sick of my small heart, made of steel
Sick of those wounds that never heal

Cause I have lived my life in debt
I’ve spent my days in deep regret
Yeah I been living in the red
Oh, cause I can’t forgive and I can’t forget
Forget...

Forget, forget, forget
Ain’t no time to regret
Yeah, it’s time to forget

Ever since I can remember
Life was like a tipping scale
Like an abacus I played with
Counting every win and fail

Cause I have lived my life in debt
I’ve spent my days in deep regret
Yeah, I’ve been living in the red
But I wanna forgive and forget

Forget, forget, forget
Ain’t no time for regret
Yeah, it’s time...

To be letting go
Oh baby you know
What I’m talking about
Got nothing to lose and nothing to prove
Oh baby, I’m bowing out
Out, I’m bowing out


Yeah, I’ve been dancing with the devil
I love that he pretends to care
If I’ll ever get to heaven
When a million dollars gets you there
Oh, all the time that I have wasted
Chasing rabbits down a hole
When I was born to be the tortoise
I was born to walk alone

Forget about it
Forget about it
Forget about it

Forget, forget, forget
Ain’t no time to regret

I’m gonna leave the past behind
I’ve had enough, I’m breaking free
No pressing stop, erase, rewind
That chain of thought that followed me

I’ve put my money where my mouth is
For the first time in my life
I’ve made mistakes but I believe that
Everything was worth the fight
Cause in the end, the road is long
But only cause it makes you strong
It’s filled with peaks & twists & turns
Sometimes you have to learn forget about it
                        
                    |
