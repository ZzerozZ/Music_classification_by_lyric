                        Bài hát: How To Love (The Voice Performance) - Christina Grimmie

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck,
Couldn't ever figure out
How to love, How to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you're in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, How to love

When you was just a young and your looks were so precious
But now your grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in the same corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, How to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you're in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, How to love

For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving I'm thinking
That you never had a love, had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me
Be the one listenin'
But I admire your popping bottles and quittin'
Just as much as you admire the beginning
Don't be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love

See I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
Yeah
You're beautiful
Yeah

And I want you to know, Oh, you're far from the usual
Far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, How to love

Yee-aa-hh

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, How to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, How to love
