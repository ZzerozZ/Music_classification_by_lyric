[Verse 1: Jessie J] 
She got a body like an hourglass, but I can give it to you all the time 
She got a booty like a Cadillac, but I can send you into overdrive (oh) 
(Stop and wait, wait for that, stop, hold up, swing your bat) 
See anybody could be bad to you, you need a good girl to blow your mind, yeah 

[Hook: Jessie J] 
Bang bang into the room (I know you want it) 
Bang bang all over you (I’ll let you have it) 
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah) 
Wait a minute tell you (ah) 
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it) 
Back, back seat of my car (I’ll let you have it) 
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah) 
Wait a minute tell you (ah) 


[Verse 2: Ariana Grande] 
She might’ve let you hold her hand in school, but I’mma show you how to graduate 
No, I don’t need to hear you talk the talk, just come and show me what your momma gave (Oooh yeah) 
(Your love gotta be baby, love but don’t say a thing) 
See anybody could be good to you, you need a bad girl to blow your mind 

[Hook] 
Bang bang into the room (I know you want it) 
Bang bang all over you (I’ll let you have it) 
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah) 
Wait a minute tell you (ah) 
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it) 
Back, back seat of my car (I’ll let you have it) 
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah) 
Wait a minute tell you (ah) 

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj] 
It’s Myx Moscato 
It’s frizz in a bottle 
It’s Nicki full throttle 
It’s oh, oh 
Swimming in the grotto 
We winning in the lotto 
We dipping in the pot of blue foam 
Kitten so good 
It’s dripping on wood 
Get a ride in the engine that could 
Go, Batman robbin’ it 
Bang, bang, cockin’ it 
Queen Nicki dominant, prominent 
It’s me, Jessie, and Ari 
If they test me they sorry 
Riders look like a Harley 
Then pull off in this Ferrari 
If he hanging we banging 
Phone ranging, he slanging 
It ain’t karaoke night but get the mic ‘cause he singing 

[Bridge] 
B to the A to the N to the G to the uh 
B to the A to the N to the G to the hey 
See anybody could be good to you, you need a bad girl to blow your mind (your mind) 

[Hook] 
Bang bang into the room (I know you want it) 
Bang bang all over you (I’ll let you have it) 
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah) 
Wait a minute tell you (ah) 
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it) 
Back, back seat of my car (I’ll let you have it) 
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah) 
Wait a minute tell you (ah)
