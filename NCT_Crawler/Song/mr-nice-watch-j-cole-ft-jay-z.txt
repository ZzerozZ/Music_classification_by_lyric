                        Yeah, everybody got a bad side
 Drop, let me see that ***
 What you say Cole ain't hot? What!
 Where you read that ***?
 You believe that ***?
 All cause some lame nigga tweet that ***
 Have you seen my shows, have you seen my hoes?
 If I wasn't hot would they be so thick?
 Guess not, got the game in a headlock
 I'm blasting at, I'm laughing at you old niggas, Redd Foxx
 Don't mind me boy, I'm red hot
 Umm nigga, they not,
 I'm over here, I'm over there
 I'm everywhere they not
 (I said)
 You'll never play me, nice try
 Ballin' in the night spot
 No more Mr Nice guy, hello Mr Nice watch
 You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot so
 You can look but don't touch
 I'll stay on my toes like them White Sox [Hook]
 Cause it cost me a lot
 My chain and my watch
 They say time is money, but really it's not
 If we ever go broke girl, than time is all we got
 And you can't make that back, no you can make that back so
 Lets ball while we here
 Lets ball while we here
 Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
 Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
 Like I'll make that back, *** it I'll make that back
 Go Nice watch
 Nice watch (I know)
 Nice watch
 No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch Stack on black, I ain't never been a high roller
 Now its racks on racks
 Never thought that I would ride Rover
 But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
 Cole World but I'm hot as ***
 Do that mean that I'm Bi-polar?
 Young black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas eve
 Coach wouldn't let him off the bench, no wonder why they quit the team
 But, I'm cut from a different sleeve
 Cole World so the wrist'll freeze
 Hurry up with your pictures please
 I gotta make history [Hook]
 It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
 They say time is money, but really it's not
 If we ever go broke girl, than time is all we got
 And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back so
 Lets ball while we here
 Lets ball while we here
 Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
 Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
 Like I'll make that back, *** it I'll make that back
 Go Nice watch
 Nice watch (I know)
 Nice watch
 No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch [Jay-Z]
 I got a Hublot I call it Tebow
 I strap that bitch with a Gator band
 Y'all niggas ball half time ya'll niggas like the gator band
 Y'all niggas need a timeout, who got these niggas all wind up
 Cocksucka I'm 7.30, y'all know where you'll niggas gon wind up
 No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch
 Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit ya'll niggas with the nice shot
 Y'all niggas, better not call the law
 Get no blood on my Audemar
 Meaning ya'll better not waste my time
 When y'all ready I'll take you all to war
 Meanwhile I'm just chopping off doors
 Put the front on the back cause I'm back and forth
 Put the front on the back of the 'bach like a boss
 So I fronting on niggas when I'm backing off
 Uh, what up Cole, show time
 Let these niggas know
 Adjust ya Roley's on these mutha***ing hoes
 Whenever you ready, go! [Hook]
 It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
 If we ever go broke, girl, then time is all we got
 (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
