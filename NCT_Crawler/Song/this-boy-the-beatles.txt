                        That boy took my love away,
He'll regret it someday,
But this boy wants you back again.
That boy isn't good for you,
Tho' he may want you too,
This boy wants you back again.
Oh, and this boy would be happy,
Just to love you, buy oh my-yi-yi,
That boy won't be happy,
Till he's seen you cry-hi-hi.
This boy wouldn't mind the pain,
Would always feel the same,
If this boy gets you back again.
This boy. This boy.
