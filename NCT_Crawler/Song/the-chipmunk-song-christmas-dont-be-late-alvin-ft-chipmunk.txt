(Ready to sing your song)

(Okay, Simon) 
(Okay) 
(Okay, Theodore) 
(Okay) 
(Okay, Alvin, Alvin, ALVIN) 
(OKAY) 
Christmas, Christmas time is near 
Time for toys and time for cheer 
We've been good, but we can't last 
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast 
Want a plane that loops the loop 
Me, I want a hula hoop 
We can hardly stand the wait 
Please Christmas, don't be late 
(Okay fellas get ready) 
(That was very good, Simon) 
(Naturally) 
(Very good Theodore) 
(Ahhh) 
(Ah, Alvin, you were a little flat, watch it) 
(Ah, Alvin, Alvin, ALVIN) 
(OKAY) 
Want a plane that loops the loop 
I still want a hula hoop 
We can hardly stand the wait 
Please Christmas, don't be late 
We can hardly stand the wait 
Please Christmas, don't be late 
(Very good, boys) 
(Let's sing it again) 
(Yeah, lets sing it again) 
(No, That's enough, lets not overdo it) 
(What do you mean overdo it) 
(We want to sing it again) 
(Now wait a minute, boys) 
(Why can't we sing it again) 
[chipmunk chatter] 
(Alvin, cut that out..Theodore, just a minute) 
(Simon will you cut that out? Boys...)
