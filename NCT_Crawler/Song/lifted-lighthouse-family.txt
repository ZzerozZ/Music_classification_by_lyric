                        I'd really love to be alone without all the
 Ache and pain and the April showers
 But it ain't long before I long for you, like a
 Ray of hope, coming through the blue moon When it all gets dark again
 The whole thing falls apart I guess
 It doesn't really matter 'bout the rain
 'Cause we'll get through it anyway
 We'll get up and start again 'Cause we could be lifted, lifted, lifted
 We could be lifted
 From the shadows, lifted
 Oh, we could be, lifted up today
 Lifted all the way, you and I forever
 Baby, lifted, lifted, lifted, hey It's undisturbable the peace we found
 In a bright new space up above the clouds
 Everything is understandable
 You don't have to say anything too loud When all our luck runs out again
 We're brought back down to solid ground
 I wouldn't say I'm mad about the rain
 But we'll get through it anyway
 We'll get back to the start again 'Cause we could be lifted, lifted, lifted
 We could be lifted
 From the shadows, lifted
 Oh, we could be, lifted up today
 Lifted all the way, you and I forever
 Baby, lifted, we could be lifted, we could be lifted, hey We could be lifted, we could be lifted
 We could be lifted, you and I forever
 We could be lifted, we could be lifted
 Yeah we could be lifted
 We could be lifted up to new horizons Lifted, lifted up today, lifted all the way
 Yeah, we could be lifted, we could be lifted
 From the shadows, we could be lifted
 Lifted upto new horizons When it all gets dark again
 It doesn't really matter 'bout the rain
 When it all gets dark again
 It doesn't really matter 'bout the rain
