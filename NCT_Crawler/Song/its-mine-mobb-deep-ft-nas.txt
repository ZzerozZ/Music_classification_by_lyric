                        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yo, you know it
 Infamous ninety nine
 Infamous two thousand
 Ain't nuttin but thugs over here, baby Yo, straight thugs on this side, it's do or die to the death
 Like the terminal ill takin they last breath
 Read your last rites, God, forgive me
 For the sin I'm about to commit, takin' a life Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
 Readin' my will, you feel what I feel, you know the deal
 Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
 Hearin' noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red Sleep with half closed eyelids
 Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
 Go easy on the bottle, niggaz love to see when
 Niggaz slippin' off point, on the strength they bet
 Scopin' your ice, appraisin' it like the Diamond District Jeweler
 With they hand on the biscuit Do ya, wanna get caught lifted, or sober, so you can react quick?
 Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you ***in' my wife
 On my thousand dollar mattress
 It's the world that I live in, Q.B. made me
 A moms that loved me and a pops that raised me Y'all need to give it up, we don't give a ***
 What y'all niggaz want, thug, life is mine
 Y'all need to give it up, 'cuz we don't give a ***
 What y'all niggaz want, thug life is mine I got the style of a still born child, I'm ill
 If it's beef, poke him with the fork, make sure he's done well
 Very, very, the sreets raised me crazy, now I'm immune to it
 So when they start shootin', we'll stop the music
 Keep it movin' that's how we do it, c'mon, c'mon Dunn
 Been through more drama than the Baldwins, you still crawlin'
 Still crawlin' Apply street rules to the office, high performance
 Rap author, made millions off of melodic, hypnotic productions
 That'll *** with your conscience and touch your emotions
 You feel me? You feel me? You feel me? I'll write a graphic page Escort niggaz to they grave, relate to the projects
 We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music
 Don't get no realer than this, it's more real than any words I can muster
 Pull the black Cadillac trucks up, what?
 Hop out them ***s like what? Y'all niggaz can't touch us Y'all need to give it up, we don't give a ***
 What y'all niggaz want, thug, life is mine
 Y'all need to give it up, 'cuz we don't give a ***
 What y'all niggaz want, thug life is mine Silk shirts on my chest show what a flirt
 Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert
 Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing
 And I'll front like my doo doo don't stink Instinct like Cuba Gooding steppin' out the latest toy
 Hazard lights blinkin', gators hit the floor
 Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin'
 Just to think, that was yesterday's action 'Cuz today goes either way, we came a long way
 From hallway steps and hand me down ***
 *** my foes, I seen the other side, NexTel cell roam
 Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home, Quincy Jones posters Wake up, guns under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
 *** is better than a novel, autobiographic
 Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
 Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
 Nastradamus, last one to blast one when the NARC's come Know how to leave anythin' in thirty seconds
 When you feel the heat, comin' and flee with the murder weapon
 I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson
 Your flesh turn to maggots, bastards, you past it
 Cremate your flesh to ashes
 You don't need a suit, no wake, no funeral, and no casket Y'all need to give it up, we don't give a ***
 What y'all niggaz want, thug life is mine
 Y'all need to give it up, 'cuz we don't give a ***
 What y'all niggaz want, thug life is mine The life is mine
 The life is mine
 The life is mine
 The life is mine Ill Will
 You need to give it up, we don't give a ***
 What y'all niggaz want, we don't give a ***
 Thug life is mine
 Y'all need to give it up, we don't give a ***
 What y'all niggaz want, thug life is mine
