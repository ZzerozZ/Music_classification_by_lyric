                        Our love is alive, and so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in.

Our love is a flame burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in.

Wherever you go, whatever you do
You know these reckless thoughts of mine are following you
I've fallen for you, whatever you do
'Cause, baby, you've shown me so many things that I never knew
Whatever it takes, baby, I'll do it for you.

Our love is alive, and so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in.

Our love is a flame burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in.

You were so young, ah, and I was so free
I may have been young, but, baby, that's not what I wanted to be.
Well, you were the one, oh, why was it me?
'Cause, baby, you show me so many things that I never see
Whatever you need, baby, you've got it from me.

Our love is alive, and so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in.

Our love is a flame burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in.

Stumblin' in, stumblin' in
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Ah, stumblin' in, mmmh, stumblin' in
Now and then firelight will catch us

Oh, stumblin' in, ah, I was stumblin' in
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in.
Oh, stumblin' in, ah, stumblin' in
I was stumblin' in
We were stumblin' in
