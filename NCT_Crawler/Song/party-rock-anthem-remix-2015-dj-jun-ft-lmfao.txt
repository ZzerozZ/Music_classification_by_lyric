And we gonna make you lose your mind

In the club party rock look up on your girl
She on my jock non stop when we in the spot
Booty move away like she on the block

Top jeans tatto cause I’m rock and roll
Half black half white diamino
Gane the money out the door

On the rise to the top no led in our zeppelin
