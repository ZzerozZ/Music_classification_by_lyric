                        Aquarius, was born the night
 The shining stars, needed brighter shining light
 Aquarius, was my savior
 It came along, like a blast from out of sight When I was weak, you came along
 Enlightened me, covered the sun
 You seduced me, I can never ever run 'Cause I, can only lose when I'm, Aquarius
 You're the power that I need
 To make it all succeed, can you hear me call? Aquarius, is the stardust
 It kills the faith, and the only one I trust
 It calls your name, and you listen
 It steals your soul, and your hunger and your lust For life, and being free
 (It's killing me, it's killing me)
 Its dragging you, it's killing me
 (it's killing me, it's killing me)
 You seduced me, I can never ever run 'Cause I, can only lose when I'm, Aquarius
 You're the power that I need
 To make it all succeed, can you hear me call?
 Can you hear me call? I wish the stars would turn you in
 And leave me standing in the wind
 I wish the devil gave you up
 And all the snow would melt and stop
 This is it, I can't run away
 You're controlling my life, and I can hear me say 'Cause I, can only lose when I'm, Aquarius
 Your the power that I need
 To make it all succeed I wish the stars would turn you in
 And leave me standing in the wind
 I wish the Devil gave you up
 And all the snow would melt and stop
                        
                    |
