                        Bài hát: Nine In The Afternoon (Radio Mix) - Panic! at the Disco

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah, we're feeling so good

Picking up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It's just the end of the world

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too

'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could, 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good, just the way that we do

When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could, 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street, down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do ya know what I mean?

Back to the place where we used to stay
Man, it feels good to feel this way
And now I know what I mean

Back to the street, back to the place
Back to the room where it all began
Back to the room where it all began

'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could, 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good, just the way that we do

When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could, 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good, just the way that we do

When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could, 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good, just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
                        
                    |
