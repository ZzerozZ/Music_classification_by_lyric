                        Take a deep breath in the mirror, he didn't like it when I wore high heels but I do.
Turn the lock and put my headphones on, he always said he didn't get this song but I do. I do.
Walked in expecting you'd be late but you got here early and you stand and wait I walk to you.
You pulled my chair out and helped me in, and you don't know how nice that is but I do.

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid.

I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end.
But on a Wednesday, in a cafe...I watched it begin again.

He said he never met one girl who had as many James Taylor records as you but I do.
We tell stories and you don't know why you're coming off a little shy but I do.

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid.

I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end.
But on a Wednesday, in a cafe...I watched it begin again.

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause he never did.
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end.
