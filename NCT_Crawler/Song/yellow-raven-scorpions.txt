                        The yellow raven sipped the air
Of thunder and of rain ...
The yellow raven sipped the air
Gentle eyes kissing the rain ...
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
Take me away to somewhere
Take me away from here!
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
Answer to my yearning
Take me away from here!
The firebird began to cry
When the music died away ...
The firebird began to cry
And smoke was slowly drifting by ...
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
Take me away to somewhere
Take me away from here!
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
Answer to my yearning
Take me away from here ...
