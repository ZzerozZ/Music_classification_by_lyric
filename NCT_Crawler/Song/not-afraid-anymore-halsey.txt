                        Bài hát: Not Afraid Anymore (Fifty Shades Darker) - Halsey

I am not afraid anymore
Standing in the eye of the storm
Ready to face this, dying to taste this, sick sweet warmth
I am not afraid anymore
I want what you got in store
I'm ready to feed now, get in your seat now

And touch me like you never
And push me like you never
And touch me like you never
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid anymore
No no no

No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no

I am not ashamed anymore
I want something so impure
You better impress now, watching my dress now fall to the floor
Crawling underneath my skin, sweet talk, better hit the sin
Begging you to take me
Devil underneath your grin, sweet thing, bet you play to win, heaven gonna hate me

And touch me like you never
And push me like you never
And touch me like you never
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid anymore
No no no

Crawling underneath my skin, sweet talk, better hit the sin
Begging you to take me
Devil underneath your grin, sweet thing, bet you play to win, heaven gonna hate me

And touch me like you never
And push me like you never
And touch me like you never
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid anymore
No no no
