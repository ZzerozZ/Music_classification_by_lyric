                        This is my church
 This is where I heal my hurts It's a natural grace
 Of watching young life shape
 It's in minor keys
 Solutions and remedies
 Enemies becoming friends
 When bitterness ends This is my church
 This is my church
 This is my church
 This is my church
 This is my church
 This is my church
 This is where I heal my hurts This is my church
 This is my church
 This is my church
 This is my church
 This is where I heal my hurts It's in the world I become
 Content in the hum
 Between voice and drum
 It's in change
 The poetic justice of cause and effect
 Respect, love, compassion This is my church
 This is where I heal my hurts
 For tonight
 God is a DJ
 God is a DJ
 God is a DJ
 This is my church
 This is my church
 This is my church
