                        Fear me you lords and lady preachers
 I descend upon your Earth from the skies
 I command your very souls you unbelievers
 Bring before me what is mine, the seven seas of rhye

 Can you hear me you peers and privy counsellors
 I stand before you naked to the eyes
 I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
 I swear that you'll be mine, the seven seas of rhye

 Sister, I live and lie for you
 Mister, do and I'll die
 You are mine, I possess you, I belong to you forever

 Storm the master-marathon, I'll fly through
 By flash and thunder-fire I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive I'll survive, I'll survive
 Then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive
 Then I'll get you
 Be gone with you, you shod and shady senators
 Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
 I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
 And with a smile I'll take you to the seven seas of rhye

 Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
 Oh I do like to be beside the sea
 Where the brass band plays, tidily, Om, pom, pom
 Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
 Oh I do like to be beside the sea
 Where they crowd beside the sea
 And besides themselves with glee beside the seaside
                        
                    |
