                        Hey! Life, look at me, I can see the reality
 'Cause when you shook me, took me outta my world, I woke up
 Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
 When you find that you left the future behind
 'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of
 Then you better beware of The happening
 One day you're up, when you turn around
 You find your world is tumbling down
 It happened to me and it can happen to you I was sure, I felt secure until love took a detour
 Yeah! Riding high on top of the world, it happened
 Suddenly it just happened
 I saw my dreams torn apart
 When love walked away from my heart
 And when you lose a precious love you need to guide you
 Something happens inside you The happening
 Now I see life for what it is
 It's not of dreams, it's not of bliss
 It happened to me and it can happen to you
 And then it happened
 Oo, and then it happened
 Oo, and then it happened
 Oo, and then it happened Is it real? Is it fake?
 Is this game of life a mistake?
 'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine for certain
 Suddenly it starts hurtin'
 I saw the light too late when that fickle finger of fate
 Yeah! It came and broke my pretty balloon
 I woke up, suddenly I just woke up, so sure
 I felt secure until love took a detour
 'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of
 Then you better beware of
 The happening
