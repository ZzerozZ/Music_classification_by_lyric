                        So long ago 
I didn't have a care about me 
I didn't know my right from wrong 
But now I know 
That you've got your love around me 
You know it makes me feel so strong 
Baby if you turn around 
And prove to me its real 
Maybe we can work it out 
Cos this is how I feel 

Do you know where you go when you give it all away 
I'll be there for you, care for you 
Love you everyday oh baby 
And do you feel the same for me? 
Everyday you're away 
And I feel a little low 
I would cry for you, die for you 
Just to let you know oh baby 
And if you come to me you know I'll make it right 

Through out all my life 
I never thought I'd have somebody 
Someone to call my own 
And now I've found 
A little bit of heaven baby 
A place to call my own 

Baby if you turn around 
And prove to me its real 
Maybe we can work it out 
Cos this is how I feel 

Do you know where you go when you give it all away 
I'll be there for you, care for you 
Love you everyday oh baby 
And do you feel the same for me? 
Everyday you're away 
And I feel a little low 
I would cry for you, die for you 
Just to let you know oh baby 
And if you come to me you know I'll make it right 

Hey there dont you know 
You gotta slow down before you know 
You gonna brake down and turn around 
Before you know, you go and break my heart 
When will you learn to be 
A little helpful when you think of me 
A little careful when you're close to me 
Coz baby i loved you from the start 

Baby if you turn around 
And prove to me its real 
Maybe we can work it out 
Cos this is how I feel 

(I love you) 

Do you know where you go when you give it all away 
I'll be there for you, care for you 
Love you everyday oh baby 
And do you feel the same for me? 
Everyday you're away 
And I feel a little low 
I would cry for you, die for you 
Just to let you know oh baby 

Do you know where you go when you give it all away 
I'll be there for you, care for you 
Love you everyday oh baby 
And do you feel the same for me? 
Everyday you're away 
And I feel a little low 
I would cry for you, die for you 
Just to let you know oh baby 
And if you come to me you know I'll make it right
