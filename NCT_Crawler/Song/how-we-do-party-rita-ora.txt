                        Bài hát: How We Do (Party) - Rita Ora

And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and And party, and party

I stumbled up to the window
Opened the curtains to blinding light
Make up all over the pillow
What went on? What went on?
What went on last night?
You look so sweet while you're dreaming, (aaay)
Holding your bottle of Tanqueray
It isn't even the weekend
Baby that's, how I know, you're the one for me

I wanna party and bull
And party and bull
And party and bull
And party, and party

Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah when I'm with you
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
Cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do

Hungover I think I'm broken
You said the fix is a shot of Jack
I said man what are you smokin'
But alright, pour a glass, and we'll throw em back

I wanna party and bull
And party and bull
And party and bull
And party, and party

Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah when I'm with you
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running
Shut down every block
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
Cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do

I wanna party and bull
And party and bull
And party and bull
And party, and party

I wanna party and bull
And party and bull
And party and bull
And party, and party

Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah when I'm with you
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
Cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
