 I'm coming home
 I'm coming home
 Tell the World I'm coming home
 Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
 I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
 I'm coming home, I'm coming home
 Tell the World that I'm coming [Diddy]
 Back where I belong, yeah I never felt so strong
 (I'm back baby)
 I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
 And if you with me put your hands high
 (Put your hands high)
 If you ever lost a light before, this ones for you
 And you, the dreams are for you
 I hear "The Tears of a Clown"
 I hate that song
 I feel like they talking to me when it comes on
 Another day another Dawn
 Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
 What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
 It's easy to be Puff, it's harder to be Sean
 What if the twins ask why I aint marry their mom (why, damn! )
 How do I respond?
 What if my son stares with a face like my own
 And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
 Sh-t! But I aint finished growing
 Another night the inevitible prolongs
 Another day another Dawn
 Just tell Taneka and Taresha I'll be better in the morn'
 Another lie that I carry on
 I need to get back to the place I belong [Skylar Grey]
 I'm coming home
 I'm coming home
 Tell the World I'm coming home
 Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
 I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
 I'm coming home, I'm coming home
 Tell the World that I'm coming [Diddy - Verse 2]
 "A house is Not a Home", I hate this song
 Is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone
 And n-ggas got the nerve to blame you for it
 And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
 But you felt it and still feel it
 And money can't make up for it or conceal it
 But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
 Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
 Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
 But we've been living as friends
 So you've been a guest in your own home
 It's time to make your house your home
 Pick up your phone, come on [Skylar Grey]
 I'm coming home
 I'm coming home
 Tell the World I'm coming home
 Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
 I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
 I'm coming home, I'm coming home
 Tell the World that I'm coming [Diddy - Verse 3]
 "Ain't No Stopping Us Now", I love that song
 Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
 I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
 We back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks
 It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
 Drove me away than embraced me
 Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
 Welcome to my homecoming
 Yeah it's been a long time coming
 Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
 Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
 Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you BIG)
 And here I stand, a better man! (a better man)
 Thank you Lord (Thank you Lord) [Skylar Grey]
 I'm coming home
 I'm coming home
 Tell the World I'm coming home
 Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
 I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
 I'm coming home, I'm coming home
 Tell the World that I'm coming
