                        Bài hát: Keep On Walking - Gabrielle Aplin

Something’s happening, you can’t see
(On your way, go on your way)
We are rolling on stormy seas
(On your way, go on your way)
You don’t like when I disagree
(On your way, go on your way)
The lies you’re spinning, you’re changing me
(On your way, go on your way)

But all that glitters is not gold
From the bruises flowers grow
I feel so much better now you’re not around
There’s no one to kick me while I’m down
No one to burn my bridges anymore
So keep on walking
‘Cause I’m not here to make you feel good
To dry up your tears and apologise for you
I feel so much better now you’re not around
So keep on walking out
Ohhhhh

You’ve been whispering way too loud
(On your way, go on your way)
You don’t say sorry, you’re far too proud
(On your way, go on your way)

But all that glitters is not gold
I stayed up to watch you go
I feel so much better now you’re not around
There’s no one to kick me while I’m down
No one to burn my bridges anymore
So keep on walking
'Cause I’m not here to make you feel good
To dry off your tears and apologise for you
I feel so much better now you’re not around
So keep on walking out, out,
Oh, oh, oh
You know I’m happy now, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
