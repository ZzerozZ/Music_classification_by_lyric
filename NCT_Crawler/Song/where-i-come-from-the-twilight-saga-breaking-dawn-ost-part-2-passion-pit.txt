                        Where I come from 
You say things will be well and fun 
Though the world around you is crumbling 
And the truth bleak as a bee 
Stay close belive 
Though things are not what they seem 
I wont let them destroy these dreams 

They're just things 
Silly little things 
They're only things 
I think we'll be alright 
I think we'll be alright 

Where I come from 
You say things will be well and fun 
Though the world around you is crumbling 
And the truth bleak as a bee 
Stay close belive 
Though things are not what they seem 
I wont let them destroy these dreams 

They're just things 
Silly little things 
They're only things 
I think we'll be alright 
I think we'll be alright 
I think we'll be alright 
I think we'll be alright
