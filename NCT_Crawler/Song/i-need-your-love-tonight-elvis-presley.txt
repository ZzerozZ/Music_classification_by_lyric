                        Oh, oh, I love you so
 Uh, uh, can't let you go
 Oh, oh, don't tell me no
 I need your love tonight Oh, gee, the way you kiss
 Sweetie, too good to miss
 Wow-wee, want more of this
 I need your love tonight I've been waiting just for tonight
 To do some lovin' and hold you tight
 Don't tell me, baby, you gotta go
 I got the hi-fi high and the lights down low Hey, now, hear what I say
 Oh, wow, you better stay
 Pow, pow, don't run away
 I need your love tonight
 I need your love tonight
 I need your love tonight Oh, oh, I love you so
 Uh, uh, can't let you go
 Oh, oh, don't tell me no
 I need your love tonight Oh, gee, the way you kiss
 Sweetie, too good to miss
 Wow-wee, want more of this
 I need your love tonight I've been waiting just for tonight
 To do some lovin' and hold you tight
 Don't tell me, baby, you gotta go
 I got the hi-fi high and the lights down low Hey, now, hear what I say
 Oh, wow, you better stay
 Pow, pow, don't run away
 I need your love tonight
 I need your love tonight
 I need your love tonight Oh, oh, I love you so
 I need your love tonight
