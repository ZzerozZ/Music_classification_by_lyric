                        On one lonely night
Drenched in rain
Oh what can I see?
And you wander about
Feel the pain
You know how far we came from home?

Who’ll let you know
If I’m safe
It’s not what I see
I have never heard life’s always hard
Go wrong, it’s alright

Don’t be shy whenever you want something
What you waiting for?
Find your door
Gotta hold your own and stay don’t run away
When you show (will to live there’s no way you)
Will lose it after finding that “anything”
Cuz life is full of points you score
You’ll see, brighter days coming
All the nights becoming day
On your mark!!

One place to be?
Where are we?
Not what it seems for sure
Coming up, bring it up
Let your mind set you free

Hold up! hear that noise?
Watch out! someone annoys?
You know, they are breaking
What we built
I’ve never seen
I’ve never thought it would come
It’s alright

Don’t be shy whenever you want something
What you waiting for?
Find your door
Gotta hold your own and stay don’t run away
When you show (will to live there’s no way you)
Will lose it after finding that “anything”
Cuz life is full of points you score
You’ll see, brighter days coming
All the nights becoming day
On your mark!!

Gosh!
Pushing too rough!
Packing to punch!
It’s just too much!
Heading to ditch!
Ignoring your wish!
Much time to miss!
But I can’t reach!!!

No matter how much you try to live good
No matter what you get for the answer
No matter where you roam for the reason
Your elation is high

Don’t be shy whenever you want something
What you waiting for?
Find your door
Gotta hold your own and stay don’t run away
When you show (will to live there’s no way you)
Will lose it after finding that “anything”
Cuz life is full of points you score
You’ll see, brighter days coming
All the nights becoming day
On your mark!!
