                        Run D M C
 Rock
 For you
 Fresh For all you sucker MC's perpetratin' a fraud
 Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold lost
 You're the kind of guy that girl ignored
 I'm drivin' Caddy, you fixin' a Ford
 My name is Joseph Simmons but my middle name's Lord
 And when I'm rockin' on the mic, you should all applaud
 Because we're wheelin', dealin', we got a funny feelin'
 We rock from the floor up to the ceilin' We groove it, you move it, it has been proven
 We calmed the seven seas because our music is soothin'
 We create it, relate it and often demonstrate it
 We'll *** a sucker MC make the other suckers hate it
 We're rising, surprising and often hypnotizing
 We always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
 No curls, no braids peasy-head and still get paid
 Jam Master cut the record up and down and cross-fade Because the rhymes I say, sharp as a nail
 Witty as can be and not for sale
 Always funky fresh, could never be stale
 Took a test to become an MC and didn't fail
 I couldn't wait to demonstrate all the super def rhymes that I create
 I'm a wizard of a word, that's what you heard
 And anything else is quite absurd
 I'm the master of a mic, that's what I say
 And if I didn't say that, you'd say it anyway Bust into the party, come in the place
 See the first things come, the music in your face
 Tears down the walls, some of the floor
 With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
 So listen to this because it can't be missed
 And you can't leave 'til you're dismissed
 You can do anything that you want to
 But you can't leave until we're through So relax your body and your mind
 And listen to us say this rhyme, hey
 You might think that you have waited
 Long enough 'til the rhyme was stated
 But if it were a test it would be graded
 With a grade that's not debated
 Nothing too deep and nothing dense
 And all our rhymes make a lot of sense So move your butt, to the cut, run amuk, you're not in a rut
 Each and everybody out there, we got the notion
 We want to see y'all all in motion
 Just shake, wiggle jump up and down
 Move your body to the funky sound, side to side, back and forth
 We're the two MC's and we're gonna go off
 Stand in place, walk or run, tap your feet, you'll be on the one
 Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
 Our DJ's better than all these bands We got all the lines and all the rhymes
 We don't drop dimes and we don't do crimes
 We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
 And never wear the vest they call the Calvin Kleins
 'Cause Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
 Don't want nobody's name on my behind
 Lee on my legs, sneakers on my feet
 D by my side and Jay with the beat Jay Jay Jay Jay Jay Jay
 We don't, we don't, we don't stop
 Don't, don't, don't, don't stop
 Jay, one two three
 Hollis Crew Crew Crew
 For, for, for, for the love now
 Cool T now
 Hah, [Incomprehensible] My, my man Jam Master
 Is in his place to be
 Jay Jay Jay Jay
 The big beat blaster
 [Incomprehensible]
 All the way live Remember you don't stop
 Kickin' it, and you don't stop
 Rock, d-dot, d-dot, rock the spot
 Stick 'em and you don't stop, hah
 Stick 'em, run rocks it well, well, well
 A-with the clientele Krush Groove, young ladies in the place
 We, we we're, we we're we're, we we're we're
 Bass, we we're in the hottest space
 Hah [Incomprehensible]
 Homeboys, now we're talkin' autographs
 Autographs and autographs
 Fly girls in the place, in the place
 Homeboys, Hollis Crew
