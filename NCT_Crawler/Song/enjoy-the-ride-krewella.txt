                        Bài hát: Enjoy the Ride - Krewella

We were born ready, ready to be free
Chasin' every thrill we could see
With our eyes steady, waking to the dream
Aching to be thrown in the ring

If nothing comes easy as long as we're breathing
We'll go all the way or go home
We were born ready, wherever it leads
What we have is all we need

'Cause if it's fast or slow
All I really know is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it's hard or soft before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride

'Cause if it's fast or slow
All I really know is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride

'Cause if it's fast or slow
All I really know is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it's hard or soft before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride

We were born hungry, hungry for the rush
Screamin' when they tell us to hush
Hit the ground runnin', leave 'em in the dust
Only run with those we can trust

If nothing comes to us
We'll fly where it's bluest
We're ready to face the unknown
We were born hungry, we'll never get enough
'Cause we're only here this once

'Cause if it's fast or slow
All I really know is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it's hard or soft before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride

Let's do it again
Let's make it tonight
Yeah let's go until the sky gets lighter

And if it's fast or slow
All I really know is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride

'Cause if it's fast or slow
All I really know is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it's hard or soft before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride

Let's do it again
Let's make it tonight
Yeah let's go until the sky gets lighter

And if it's fast or slow
All I really know is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride
