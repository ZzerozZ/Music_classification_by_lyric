Artist(Band):Spice Girls


Say you'll be there


I'm giving you everything all that joy
can bring this I swear

Last time that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends
Hey,
but now we're going round in circles,
tell me will this deja vu never end? Oh
And now you tell me that you've fallen in love,
well I never ever thought that would be
This time you gotta take it easy
throwing far too much emotions at me
But any fool can see they're falling,
I gotta make you understand

I'm giving you everything all that joy can bring this I swear
(I give you everything)
And all that I want from you is a promise you will be there
Say you will be there (Say you will be there)
Won't you sing it with me

If you, put two and two together
you will see what our friendship is for (Oh)
If you can't work this equation then
I guess I'll have to show you the door
There is no need to say you love me,
It would be better left unsaid

I'm (I'm) giving you everything (I give you everything)
all that joy(all the joy) can bring this I swear (yes I swear)
and (and) all that I want from you (all I want from you) is a promise
(is a promise) you will be there
Yeah, I want you

Any fool can see they're falling,
gotta make you understand

I'll give you everything on this I swear
Just promise you'll always be there
I'm giving you everything (I m giving you everything)
all that joy (all that joy can bring) can bring this I
swear (yes I swear)
and all that I want from you (all that I want from you) is a promise
(I want you to promise you'll) you
will be there (always be there)

I'm giving you everything (I m giving you everything)
all that joy (all that joy can bring) can bring this I swear (yes I swear)
and all that I want from you (all that I want from you) is a promise
(I want you to promise you'll)
you will be there (always be there)

*starts fading*
I'm giving you everything
all that joy can bring yes i swear. (yes i swear)

*fades*
                        
                    |
