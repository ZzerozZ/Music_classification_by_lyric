                        Bài hát: I Will Always Love You - Whitney Houston

If I should stay,
I would only be in your way.
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way.

And I will always love you.
I will always love you.
You, my darling you. Mmm.

Bittersweet memories,
that is all I'm taking with me.
So, goodbye. Please, don't cry.
We both know I'm not what you need.

And I will always love you.
I will always love you.

(Instrumental solo)

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you'll have all you've dreamed of.
And I wish to you, joy and happiness.
But above all this, I wish you love.
And I will always love you.

I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I, I will always love you.
You, darling, I love you.

Ooh, I'll always, I'll always love you
                        
                    |
