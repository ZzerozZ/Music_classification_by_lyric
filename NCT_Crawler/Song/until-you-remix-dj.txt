                        Baby life was good to me
But you just made it better
I love the way you stand by me
Through any kind of weather
I don’t wanna run away
Just wanna make your day
When you felt the world is on your shoulders
Don’t wanna make it worse
Just wanna make us work
Baby tell me I will do whatever

[Chorus]
It feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me
Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me
Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me
Baby nobody, nobody,until you

Baby it just took one hit of you now I'm addicted
You never know what's missing
Till you get everything you need,yeah

I don't wanna run away
Just wanna make your day
When you feel the world is on your shoulders
Don't wanna make it worse
Just wanna make us work
Baby tell me,I'll do whatever

Chorus

See it was enough to know
If I ever let you go
I would be no one
Cos I never thought I'd feel
All the things you made me feel
Wasn't looking for someone until you

[Chorus repeat twice]
Nobody, nobody, until you
                        
                    |
