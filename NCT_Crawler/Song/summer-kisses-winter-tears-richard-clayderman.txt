                        Bài hát: Summer Kisses Winter Tears - Richard Clayderman

Summer kisses, Winter tears
 That was what she gave to me
 Never thought that I'd travel all alone
 The trail of memories

 Happy hours, lonely years
 But I guess I can't complain
 For I still recall the Summer sun
 Through all the Winter rain

 The fire of love, the fire of love
 Can burn from afar
 And nothing can light the dark of the night
 Like a falling star
 Summer kisses, Winter tears
 Like the stars they fade away
 Leaving me to spend my lonely nights
 With dreams of yesterday

 The fire of love, the fire of love
 Can burn from afar
 And nothing can light the dark of the night
 Like a falling star
 Summer kisses, Winter tears
 Like the stars they fade away
 Leaving me to spend my lonely nights
 With dreams of yesterday

 Leaving me to spend my lonely nights
 With dreams of yesterday
 Summer kisses, Winter tears
                        
                    |
