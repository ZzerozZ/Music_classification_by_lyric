                        You've been around for a long, long time
 I've seen you here before
 You'll meet some guy who really turns you on
 And sneak out of the side door

You'll never look my way I know
 I ain't much to look at
 But one of these nights you're going
 Home with me, I'm gonna see to that

Well I'm just waiting out my time
 Standing at the end of the line
 I got a lot of loving I'm saving
 Inside for you

 Yes I'm just waiting out my time
 Standing at the end of the line
 But you're gonna know that you've
 Been loved when I get through loving you

You look right at me and smiled
 One time just last week
 And what one look from you did to me
 It kept me in my seat

But you picked another guy to entertain
 You that night
 And I was left to entertain myself
 So I got into a fight 

Well I'm just waiting out my time
 Standing at the end of the line
 I got a lot of loving I'm saving
Inside for you

 Yes I'm just waiting out my time
 Standing at the end of the line
 But you're gonna know that you've
 Been loved when I get through loving you

Well I'm just waiting out my time
 Standing at the end of the line
 I got a lot of loving I'm saving
 Inside for you

 Yes I'm just waiting out my time
 Standing at the end of the line
 But you're gonna know that you've
 Been loved when I get through loving you
                        
                    |
