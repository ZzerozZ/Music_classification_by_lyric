                        Bài hát: Sad Machine - Porter Robinson

Is anyone there?
Oh-
Hi!

Who survived?
Somebody new?
Anyone else but you?

On a lonely night
Was a blinding light.
A hundred leaders would be borne of you.

And though I know, since you've awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you
She'll go alone, and never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend on you

And though I know, since you've awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you
She'll go alone, and never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend (I'll depend on you)

I don't know much about your life beyond these walls
The fleeting sense of love within these God-forsaken halls
And I can hear it in his voice, in every call
This girl who's slept a hundred years has something after all

And though I know, since you've awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you
I'll go alone, and never speak of you again
We depend on you, we depend on you

And though I know since you've awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you
She'll go alone, and never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend on you

And though I know since you've awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you
She'll go on, and never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend (I'll depend on you)
                        
                    |
