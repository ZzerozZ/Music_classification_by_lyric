Âu Mỹ khác|

                        V1
Sitting on the bus
Looking through the window
And I close my eyes
I see the shade of your smiling face
Your smiling face
When you walk in through the door
Smiling face
Like I've never seen before

V2
Standing in the rain
Nearly washed the day away
Then I think of you
I know the sight of your smiling face
Your smiling face
And it's always here with me
Smiling face
Well I wonder could it be

CHORUS
I still know
That I'm never gonna find you
But I do believe
That you're standing right behind
Will I ever get
The answer to my question
Life will go on, on

V3
Lying on my bed
Staring at the ceiling
Then I close my eyes again
The only thing that's clear to me
Is your smiling face
Maybe I should wake again
Smiling face
Maybe I should let it end

CHORUS
                        
                    |
