[Verse 1]
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up, don't seem so simple
I just *** two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me
When I'm *** up, that's the real me, babe

[Outro]
Yene fikir, ewedeshalo
Yene fikir, fikir, fikir
Yene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir
Ewedeshalo, ewedeshalo
Yene fikir, fikir, fikir
Yene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir
