Feel it in my bones
This anticipation
See him through the smoke
So hard to be patient

There is a clock in mind
We running out of time
Killing it goes so easily
I want to feel him breathe
I want his hands on me
You know there's just one thing I need
You know there's just one thing I need,
Just one thing I need, I need, I need, I need, I need

Alright
Come on, lift me with the right song
I've been waiting for it all night, baby
Before they turn the lights on, yeah
Come on, lift me with the right, ight, ight, ight song

Run that bass, run that bass
Through my veins
Come and take me away, take me away

Alright
Come on, lift me with the right song
Come on, lift me with the right, ight, ight, ight song

Don't know where this goes
I let the wind take me
Into the unknown
No more hesitating

There is a clock in mind
We running out of time
Killing it goes so easily
I want to feel him breathe
I want his hands on me
You know there's just one thing I need
You know there's just one thing I need
You know there's just one thing I need, just one thing I need
I need, I need, I need, I need,
Yeah, yeah

Alright
Come on, lift me with the right song
I've been waiting for it all night, baby
Before they turn the lights on, yeah
Come on, lift me with the right, ight, ight, ight song

Run that bass, run that bass
Through my veins
Come and take me away, take me away

Alright
Come on, lift me with the right song
Come on, lift me with the right, ight, ight, ight song

The right, ight, ight, ight song, the right, ight, ight, ight song
The right, ight, ight, ight, song
