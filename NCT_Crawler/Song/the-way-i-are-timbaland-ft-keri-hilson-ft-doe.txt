                        I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we'd be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me girl

(Oh) Baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go and touch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Work it out 'til we get it right

Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I'm on?)
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like...

I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express

We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me girl

Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go and touch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Work it out 'til we get it right

Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I'm on?)
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are

Baby girl, I don't got a huge ol' house I rent a room in a house

So listen baby girl,
I love you just the way you are, the way you are

Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta floss for me

We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right
