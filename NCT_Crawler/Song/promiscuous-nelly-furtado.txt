Promiscuous by Nelly Furtado
N:Am I throwing you off?
T:Nope!
N:Didn't think so...
T:How ya doin' young lady
The feeling that you gave me really drives me crazy
You dont have a player on your trunk
I was at a loss of words
First time that we spoke

N:If ya lookin' for a girl that’ll treat you right
If you lookin’ for her in the day time in the light
T:You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

N: You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it?

T:All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What’s the problem? I don’t see no ring on your hand

I be the first to admit it, I’m curious about you, you seem so innocent

N: You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I’m tired of running, lets walk for a minute

Chorus-
T:Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I’m all alone
And it's you that I want

N: Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I’m all yours
What you waiting for?

T:Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

N: Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll
You ready?

N: Roses are red
Verse-
Some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead
But you're still kinda cute

T:Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through

N: I’m out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

T:They call me Thomas
last name Crown
Recognize game
I'm a lay mine's down

N: I'm a big girl I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I’ma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
T:I want you on my team
N: So does everybody else.

T:Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain’t nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go

N: What kind of girl do you take me for?

T:Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I’m all alone
And it's you that I want

N: Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I’m all yours
What you waiting for?

T:Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

N: Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll
You ready?
Chorus-
T: Don't be mad, don't get mean
N: Don't get mad, don't get mean

T: Hey! Don't be mad, don't get mean
N: Don't get mad, don't be mean

T:Wait! I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on

N:I can see you with nothing on
feelin' on me before you bring that on

T: Bring that on
N: You know what I mean

T:Girl, I’m a freak you shouldn't say those things

N:I’m only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

T:It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

N:Hey is that the truth or are you talking trash
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash

Chorus-
T: Promiscuous Girl
Wherever you are
I’m all alone
And its you that I want

N: Promiscuous Boy
I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy
The way you're making me wait

T: Promiscuous Girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

N: Promiscuous Boy
We're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more
