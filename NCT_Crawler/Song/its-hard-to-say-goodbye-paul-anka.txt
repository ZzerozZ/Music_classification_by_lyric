                        There’s something in your eyes, 
That’s far too revealing 
Why must it be like this? 
A love without feeling 
There’s something wrong with you I know, 
I see it in your eyes 
Believe me when I say, 
It’s gonna be ok 

I told you from the start, 
I won’t be demanding (I won’t be demanding) 
If you have a change of heart, 
I’ll be understanding (I’ll be understanding) 
When love becomes a broken heart 
And dreams begin to die 
Believe me when I say, 
We’ll work it out some way 

I’ll never try to hold you back 
I wouldn’t try controlling you 
If it’s what you want, 
It’s what I want 
I want what’s best for you 
And if there’s something else that you’re looking for 
I’ll be the first to help you try 
Believe me when I say, 
It’s hard to say, goodbye 

We’ve lost that loving touch 
We use to feel so much 
I try to hide, the truth that’s in my eyes 
(A love without feeling) 
But when I feel, we’re not in love 
I know I’m losing you 
Believe me when I say 
We’ll work it out some way

I’ll never try to hold you back 
I wouldn’t try controlling you 
If it’s what you want, 
It’s what I want 
I want what’s best for you 
And if there’s something else that you’re looking for 
I’ll be the first to help you try 
Believe me when I say, 
It’s hard to say, goodbye 

Don’t say goodbye... 

If it’s what you want 
It’s what I want, 
I want what’s best for you 

I’ll never try to hold you back 
I wouldn’t try controlling you 
If it’s what you want, 
It’s what I want 
I want what’s best for you 
And if there’s something else that you’re looking for 
I’ll be the first to help you try 
Believe me when I say, 
It’s hard to say goodbye 

I’ll never try to hold you back 
I wouldn’t try controlling you 
If it’s what you want, 
It’s what I want 
I want what’s best for you 
And if there’s something else that you’re looking for 
I’ll be the first to help you try 
Believe me when I say, 
It’s hard to say goodbye
