dada......
While you are away
My heart comes undone
Slowly unravels
In a ball of yarn
The devil collects it
With a grin
Our love
In a ball of yarn
He'll never return it
So when you come back
We'll have to make new love
He'll never return it
When you come back
We'll have to make new love
While you are away
My heart comes undone
Slowly unravels
In a ball of yarn
The devil collects it
With a grin
Our love, our love,
In a ball of yarn
He'll never return it
When you come back
We'll have to make new love
He'll never return it
When you come back
We'll have to make new love
He'll never return it
When you come back
We'll have to make new love
He'll never return it
When you come back
We'll have to make new love
