                        Our friends think we're opposites
 Falling in and out of love
 They all said we'd never last
 Still we manage to stay together
 There's no easy explanation for it
 But whenever there's a problem
 We always work it out somehow
 Work it out somehow

 They said it wouldn't last
 We had to prove them wrong
 Cause I've learned in the past
 That love will never do without you

 Other guys have tried before
 To replace you as my lover
 Never did I have a doubt
 Boy it's you I can't do without
 I feel better when I have you near me
 Cause no other love around
 Has quite the same ooh ooh (ha ha ha!)
 Like you do do do do babe

 They said it wouldn't last
 We had to prove them wrong
 Cause I've learned in the past
 That love will never do without you
