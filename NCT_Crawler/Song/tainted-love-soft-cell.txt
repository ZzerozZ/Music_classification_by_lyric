                        Sometimes I feel I've got to
 Run away I've got to
 Get away
 From the pain you drive into the heart of me
 The love we share
 Seems to go nowhere
 And I've lost my light
 For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night Once I ran to you (I ran)
 Now I'll run from you
 This tainted love you've given
 I give you all a boy could give you
 Take my tears and that's not nearly all
 Oh tainted love (oh oh oh oh)
 Tainted love Now I know I've got to
 Run away I've got to
 Get away
 You don't really want it any more from me
 To make things right
 You need someone to hold you tight
 And you'll think love is to pray
 But I'm sorry I don't pray that way Once I ran to you (I ran)
 Now I'll run from you
 This tainted love you've given
 I give you all a boy could give you
 Take my tears and that's not nearly all
 Oh tainted love (oh oh oh oh)
 Tainted love Don't touch me please
 I cannot stand the way you tease
 I love you though you hurt me so
 Now I'm going to pack my things and go
 Tainted love (oh oh oh oh), tainted love (oh oh oh oh)
 Tainted love (oh oh oh oh), tainted love (oh oh oh oh)
 Touch me baby, tainted love (touch me tainted love)
 Touch me baby, tainted love (touch me tainted love)
 Tainted love
 Tainted love
 Tainted love
