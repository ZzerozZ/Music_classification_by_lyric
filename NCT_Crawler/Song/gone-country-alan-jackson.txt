Pop|

                        She's been playing in a room on a strip
 For ten years in Vegas
 And every night she looks in the mirror
 But she only ages
 She's been reading about Nashville and all
 The records that everybody's buying
 Says, "I'm a simple girl myself
 Grew up on long island" So she packs her bags to try to her hand
 Says, "This might be my last chance" She's gone country, look at them boots
 She's gone country, back to her roots
 She's gone country, a new kind of suit
 She's gone country, here she comes Well the folk scene is dead
 But he's holding out in the village
 He's been writing songs speaking out
 Against wealth and privilege
 He says, "I don't believe in money
 But a man could make him a killin'"
 'Cause some of that stuff don't sound
 Much different than Dylan I hear down there it's changed you see
 They're not as backwards as they used to be He's gone country, look at them boots
 He's gone country, back to her roots
 He's gone country, a new kind of suit
 He's gone country, here he comes He commutes to L.A.
 But he's got a house in the valley
 But the bills are piling up
 And the pop scene just ain't on the rally
 And he says, "Honey I'm a serious composer
 Schooled in voice and composition"
 But with the crime and the smog these days
 This ain't no place for children Lord, it sounds so easy, it shouldn't take long
 Be back in the money in no time at all He's gone country, look at them boots
 He's gone country, back to his roots
 He's gone country, a new kind of suit
 He's gone country, here he comes Yeah, he's gone country, a new kind of walk
 He's gone country, a new kind of talk
 He's gone country, look at them boots
 He's gone country, oh, back to his roots He's gone country
 He's gone country
 Everybody's gone country
 Yeah we've gone country
 The whole world's gone country
                        
                    |
