Title: Wonderful World
I've been down so low
people look at me and they know,
they can tell something is wrong
like I dont belong,
well, staring through a window
standing outside there
just to happy to care
and I wana be like them
but I'll mess it up again,
I tripped them out
when God kicked outside everybody's soul.

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But i cant feel it right now,
when I thought I was doing well
but I just want to cry now,
Well I know that its a wonderful world
from the sky down to the sea,
but I can only see when you're here,
here with me.

Sometimes I feel so full
that it just comes spilling out,
it's uncomfortable to see
I give it away so easily,
but if I had someone I would do anything
and never never never
neverlet you feel alone
I wont, I wont leave u on your own,
who am I to dream,
dreams are for fools,
they always let you down.

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I cant feel it right now,
I thought i was doing well
but I just want to cry now,
Well I know that its a wonderful world
from the sky down to the sea,
but I can only see when you're here,
here with me.

And I wish that I could make it better,
I'd give anything for you to call me,
Maybe just a little letter
Oh it could start again.

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I cant feel it right now,
I thought I was doing well
but I just want to cry now,
Well I know that its a wonderful world
from the sky down to the sea,
but I can only see when you're here,
here with me.

I know that its a wonderful world
but I cant feel it right now,
Iv got all the right clothes to wear
i just wana cry now,
I know that it's a wonderful world
from the sky down 2 the sea,
But I can only see well when ur here,
here with me.

And I know that it's a wonderful world
When your with me.
