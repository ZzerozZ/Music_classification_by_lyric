                        It could all be so simple.
 But you'd rather make it hard.
 Loving you is like a battle
 And we both end up with scars.
 Tell me who I have to be
 To get some reciprocity.
 See no one loves you more than me
 And no one ever will.

 Is this just a silly game
 That forces you to act this way?
 Forces you to scream my name
 Then pretend that you can't stay.
 Tell me who I have to be
 To get some reciprocity.
 See no one loves you more than me
 And no one ever will.

 No matter how I think we grow
 You always sem to let me know it ain't workin'
 No, and when I try to walk away
 You'd hurt yourself to make me stay.
 This is crazy. Oh this is crazy.
 Care for me, care for me.

 I keep letting you back in.
 How can I explain myself?
 As painful as this thing has been,
 I just can't be with no one else.

 See I know what we got to do.
 You let go, and I'll let go too.
 'Cause no one's hurt me more than you
 And no one ever will.

 No matter how I think we grow
 You always sem to let me know it ain't workin'
 No, and when I try to walk away
 You'd hurt yourself to make me stay.
 This is crazy. Oh this is crazy.
 Care for me, care for me.
 I know you care for me.
 There for me, there for me.
 Said you'd be there for me.
 Cry for me, cry for me.
 You said you'd die for me.
 Give to me, give to me.
 Why won't you live for me?
 Care for me, care for me.
 You said you'd care for me.
 There for me, there for me.
 Said you'd be there for me.
 Cry for me, cry for me.
 You said you'd die for me.
 Where were you when I needed you?
 Care.
 There.
 Cry.
 Give.
