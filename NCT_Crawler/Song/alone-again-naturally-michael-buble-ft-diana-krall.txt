                        In a little while from now
 If I'm not feeling any less sour
 I promised myself to treat myself
 And visit a nearby tower And climbing to the top
 To throw myself off
 In an effort to make it clear to who
 Ever what it's like when you're shattered Left standing in the lurch, at a church
 Where people are saying
 My God that's tough, she stood him up
 No point in us remaining May as well go home
 As I did on my own
 Alone again, naturally To think that only yesterday
 I was cheerful, bright and gay
 Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do
 The role I was about to play And as if to knock me down
 Reality came around
 And without so much as a mere touch
 Cut me into little pieces Leaving me to doubt
 Talk about God and His mercy
 For if He really does exist
 Why did He desert me In my hour of need?
 I truly am indeed
 Alone again, naturally It seems to me that there are more hearts
 Broken in the world that can't be mended
 Left unattended
 What do we do? what do we do? Now looking back over the years
 And what ever else that appears
 I remember I cried when my father died
 Never wishing to hide the tears And at sixty five years old
 My mother, God rest her soul
 Couldn't understand, why the only man
 She had ever loved had been taken Leaving her to start with a heart
 So badly broken
 Despite encouragement from me
 No words were ever spoken And when she passed away
 I cried and cried all day
 Alone again, naturally
 Alone again, naturally
                        
                    |
