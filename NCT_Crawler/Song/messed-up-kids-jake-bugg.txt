                        Johnny deals a bit of blow on the side
 Thinks that he's invincible, hates a fight
 Jenny walks the streets alone, she was fine
 But she got kicked out of her home in hard times The messed up kids are on the corner with no money
 They sell their time, they sell their drugs, they sell their body
 And everywhere I see a sea of empty pockets
 Beautiful girls with eyes so dark within their sockets
 So far away
 It's a washed out Saturday
 The sky all pastel shades
 Under breeze block palisades
 Lights are smashed the streets are closed in the town
 Places no one really goes to hang around
 Gave up on us long ago with no hope
 All you hear is the cold wind blow and get stoned The messed up kids are on the corner with no money
 They sell their time, they sell their drugs, they sell their body
 And everywhere I see a sea of empty pockets
 Beautiful girls with eyes so dark within their sockets So far away
 It's a washed out Saturday
 The sky all pastel shades
 Under breeze block palisades The messed up kids are on the corner with no money
 They sell their time, they sell their drugs, they sell their body
 And everywhere I see a sea of empty pockets
 Beautiful girls with eyes so dark within their sockets So far away
 It's a washed out Saturday
 The sky all pastel shades
 Under breeze block palisades
