                        Bài hát: Numb - David Archuleta

I think I’ll take a second chance
I won’t be passing by these waters again
Wanna feel redemption’s hand
See this life only for what it, what it is
I know the river’s not too wide
I can see it for myself with my own eyes
Someone out there’s on my side
It’s not my place to question why

Chorus

Everybody needs time away
To wake up with the sun on their face
I’m not there yet but i know
That I don’t wanna feel numb
Falling over all of my shadows
Yeah I’m all done
Coz none of that ever really mattered
It hurts to live so wide awake, oh
But it’s a chance I can take
I won’t run run run

Coz I don’t wanna feel numb

So deep inside these hills I run
To a place where I can see til Kingdom Come
See the days one by one
And love this life only for what it, what it is
I hear the whispers in the stars
The words that tell us more of who we are
Someone out there’s not that far
Everything I need is here now

Repeat Chorus

Yeah!

A tidal wave brought to life
Rushing over every doubt of mine
Open soul open sky
Everything, everything is right
I don’t wanna feel numb
Falling over all of my shadows
Yeah I’m all done
Coz none of that ever really mattered
It hurts to live so wide awake, oh
But it’s a chance I can take
I won’t run run run
I won’t run run run

I don’t wanna feel numb
I don’t wanna feel numb
I don’t wanna feel numb
                        
                    |
