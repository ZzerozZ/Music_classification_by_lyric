                        Storybook endings, fairy tales coming true 
Deep down inside we want to believe they still do 
And a secret is taught, it's our favourite part of the story 
Let's just admit we all want to make it too 

Ever ever after 
If we just don't get it our own way 
Ever ever after 
It may only be a wish away 

Starting your fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve 
Sometimes you reach what's real just by making believe 
Unafraid, unashamed 
There is joy to be claimed in this world 
You even might wind up being glad to be you 

Ever ever after 
Ever Ever After lyrics on 
Though the world will tell you it's not smart 
Ever ever after 

The world can be yours if you let your heart 
Believe in ever after 

No wonder your heart feels it's flying 
Your head feels it's spinning 
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning 
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through 

To ever ever after 
Forever could even start today 
Ever ever after 
Maybe it's just one wish away 
Your ever ever after
Ever ever ever after 

(I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss) 

Oh, for ever ever after
                        
                    |
