                        I remember all the cries

It's a secret dream
I'm lost in your love.
You
your lonesome eyes are all I wanna know

Helpless tears can never stop the rain.
Only you can turn my life
can turn it just this way.

A touch in the night - it
feels like heaven

Touched in the night -
so lucky in love.
Lost in your light - another secret

Touched in the night - whatever I do.

You
my angel in disguise

Deep inside my heart
like the inner light.
I believe in all your
promise and your lies

But I feel in the end I'll lose.

Only you can turn my life
can turn it just this way.
A touch in the night - it
feels like heaven

Touched in the night -
so lucky in love.
Tonight I feel
I feel for you

Tonight I call
I'm calling your name

Tonight I feel
I feel for you - tonight.

Only you can turn my life
can turn it just this way. . . .
