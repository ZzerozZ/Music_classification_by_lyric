                        Bài hát: You Mean Everything To Me - Guitar

You are the answer to my lonely prayer
You are an angel from above
I was so lonely till you came to me
With the wonder of your love

I don't know how I ever live before
You are my life, my destiny
Oh my darling, I love you so
You mean everything to me

If you should ever, ever go away
There would be lonely tears to cry
The sun above would be never shine again
There would be teardrops in the sky

So hold me close and never let me go
And say our love will always be
Oh my darling, I love you so
You mean everything to me
                        
                    |
