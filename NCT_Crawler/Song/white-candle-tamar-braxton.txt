                        Bài hát: White Candle - Tamar Braxton

Love don't never mean well when you're living it alone
 And everybody knows a broken heart's gotta mend on its own
 In life, I know anything worth having ain't easy
 But that don't mean that we should make things more difficult
 I can feel the distance between us
 Stand inside the sun never felt so far apart
 And you ain't making it better
 When it's gone, it's gone forever
 I was running out of love White candle
 White candle
 White candle
 Don't let our love die
 Cause I don't wanna watch us burn out
 Don't wanna add fuel to the flame
 Is this how love turns out
 Don't let our love die
 White candle
 White candle
 White candle
 Don't let our love melt away 
Ain't gonna point fingers, cause I know it takes two
 And ain't no sense in fighting cause we got nothing to prove
 If it's worth it to break it, didn't mean a thing at all
 Is it too late, can we make it. 
Light a fire with our hearts and let it burn 
Cause I can feel the distance between us
 Stay inside the side or else fall apart
 Baby and you know we ain't making it better
 When it's gone, it's gone forever
 I was running out of love White candle
 White candle
 White candle
 Don't let our love die
 Cause I don't wanna watch us burn out
 Don't wanna add fuel to the flame
 Is this how love turns out
 Don't let our love die
 White candle
 White candle
 White candle
 Don't let our love melt away
 Away, that's the story of our love oh yeah
 Just a broken heart, trying to make it back again
 Can we fix it baby
 Can we fix it babe White candle
 White candle
 White candle
 Don't let us die
 Cause I don't wanna watch us burn out
 Don't wanna add fuel to the flame
 Is this how love turns out
 Don't let our love die
 White candle
 White candle
 White candle
 Don't let our love melt away 
White candle for our love
