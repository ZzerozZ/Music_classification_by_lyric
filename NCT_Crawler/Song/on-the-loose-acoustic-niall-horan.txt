                        Bài hát: On The Loose (Acoustic) - Niall Horan

I know what she's like
She's out of her mind
And wraps herself around the truth
She'll jump on that flight and meet you that night
And make you tear up the room
Yeah, she loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves

She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming)
She's coming for you
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)

She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She'll dance in the dark
A real work of art
Her eyes could burn down the room
So get out while you can
You don't understand
She doesn't know how to lose

Yeah, she loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)

She's on the loose (she's coming)
She's coming for you
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She'll run with your mind and pull you in tight
Then trade you in for something new

I know what it's like, I fell for it twice
And now I'm just warning you
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming)

She's coming for you
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose
She's on the loose
