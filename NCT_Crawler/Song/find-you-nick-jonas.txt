                        Bài hát: Find You - Nick Jonas

I look for you in the center of the sun
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you
I taste the words that keep falling out your mouth
You got a logic I can never figure out
If I could hold you then I'd never put you down
But I never really know just where to find you

Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I
Try, try, try, but I, but I
Try, try, try, but I
But I never really know just where to find you

You think you know how to get under my skin
It's okay for now but it's never permanent
Knock on the door but there's no one listening
And I never really know just where to find you
You live for love but you never really tried
You say it's not but it's always on your mind
Keep chasing gold but you're used to silver lines
But I never really know just where to find you

Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I
Try, try, try, but I, but I
Try, try, try, but I
But I never really know just where to find you

Bad idea, I'm chasing a feeling
Bad idea, I don't even need it
Bad idea looking for me tonight, tonight

I look for you in the center of the sun
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you

Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I
Try, try, try, but I, but I
Try, try, try, but I
But I never really know just where to find you
