                        Bài hát: One Chance To Dance - Naughty Boy, Joe Jonas

I'm no professional dancer
Baby, I ain't no Michael Jackson
But I would learn any move
Get with any groove
Just to dance with you

I'll let my feet do the talking
I met her out when I'm walking
Show you what I can do
And you know it's true
When I dance with you

Oh-oh-oh-oh, give me your hand
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'll be who I am
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I ain't no Michael Jackson
But give me one chance, one chance to dance
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Give me one chance, one chance to dance
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Give me one chance, one chance to dance
I'm no professional dancer
Baby, give me your answer
I'll practice everyday
Don't care what record plays
When I dance with you

You take the lead and I'll follow
I'll take my pride and I'll swallow
May not have Jagger moves
But I ain't gonna lose
When I dance with you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, give me your hand

I'll be who I am
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I ain't no Michael Jackson
But give me one chance, one chance to dance
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Give me one chance, one chance to dance
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Give me one chance, one chance to dance
And if I fall to my knees
I won't crumble and freeze
I'll pick myself up and I'll try it again, and again until you see
I'll take you by the hand
Just listen to me
Oh baby, if you could just give me a half of a chance

To make you understand
I know exactly who I am
I ain't no Michael Jackson
But give me one chance, one chance to dance
Give me one chance, one chance to dance

Give me one chance, one chance to dance
I ain't no Michael Jackson
But give me one chance, one chance to dance
One chance, one chance to dance
One chance, one chance to dance
