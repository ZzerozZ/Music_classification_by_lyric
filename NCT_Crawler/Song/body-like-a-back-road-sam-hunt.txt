                        Bài hát: Body Like A Back Road - Sam Hunt

[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Outro]
I'ma take it slow
As fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
                        
                    |
