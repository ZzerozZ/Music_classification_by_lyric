                        Bài hát: Take Back Home Girl - Chris Lane, Tori Kelly

Duffle bag, backseat
My dash, your feet
Those other side of the highway headlights making you shine
My hand, your leg
Playlist playing
Even though I haven't made it yet
I'm dragging it, dropping it in my mind

You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl

Home, home, home girl
You're the kind I wanna take a ride with
Sit by on a Friday night
In the stadium lights, side by side
All the ladies like, "Yeah, she's doing just fine"
Everybody in the bleachers, they all gon' want to meet ya
From my teachers to my preacher, my little crowd pleaser
Parading with you feeling homecoming cool, yeah

I wanna drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl

Home, home, home girl, oh
You're a take back, you're a take back (woah, woah)
You're a take back home girl (you're a take back home)
(Woah, woah)
You're a take back home girl
(Woah, woah) oh
You got that down home, homegrown, found on good ground soul
That down home, home grown, found on good ground soul

You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl

Home, home, home girl (you're a take back home)
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl, oh, oh
You're a take back, you're a take back (woah, woah)
You're a take back home girl (you're a take back home, yeah)
You're a take back home, yeah (you're a take back home)
