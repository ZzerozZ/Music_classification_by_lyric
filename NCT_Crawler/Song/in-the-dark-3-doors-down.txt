                        Bài hát: In The Dark - 3 Doors Down

Whenever the lights go down
That's when she comes alive
Ooh ooh
Maybe it's just something
that you can only see in the light
Ooh ooh
A pretty little vixen dancing out on the scene
But the lights are shining, so she's keeping it clean
Don't get too close
Boy, don't touch her skin
Or you'll never feel the same way again

If everything you see is what you're believing
Then she'll be holding your heart
And by the time the sun goes down
You won't know who you are
She likes to do it in the dark
She likes to do it in the dark, oh

Whenever the darkness comes, she'll have you
right where she wants, ooh ooh
Just when you think it's all over
It's where it all starts
It sounds like an angel is calling my name
It might be the devil, but they all sound the same
And all her moves won't let you get away
She's gonna make your mind come with you to stay

If everything you see is what you're believing
Then she'll be holding your heart
And by the time the sun goes down
You won't know who you are
She likes to do it in the dark
She likes to do it in the dark, oh

She likes to do it in the dark
Oh oh, oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh

If everything you see is what you're believing
Then she'll be holding your heart
And by the time the sun goes down
You won't know who you are
She is gonna make you think you were leading
But she had you from the start
And by the time the sun goes down
You won't know who you are
She likes to do it in the dark
She likes to do it in the dark
She likes to do it in the dark, oh

Oh
She likes to do it in the dark
                        
                    |
