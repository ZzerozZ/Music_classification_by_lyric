[Alicia]
Hey yo B
[Beyonce]
What up A
[Alicia]
What we want?
[Beyonce]
Want them to say

[Chorus]
Say you love me, Say you love me
Then put it in a love song (Put it in a love song)
Say you need me, Say you need me
Then write it in a letter for me (Oh oh oh)
Say you want me, Say you want me
Then text me on the cell phone (Text me on my cell phone)
Say you love me, Say you love me
Then put me in a love song (Oh)

[Alicia]
If you say you want me, yeah,
You say you want me
If you do the right thing, we can be together
I'm not easy, yeah, you gotta work for it
I'm the real thing, yeah, you gotta please me

All that talk, and boy you better walk it
All that front and that's not how you do it
If you really need me like you say you need me
Baby better show me, baby better come and say

[Chorus]
Say you love me, Say you love me
Then put it in a love song (Put it in a love song)
Say you need me, Say you need me
Then write it in a letter for me (Oh oh oh)
Say you want me, Say you want me
Then text me on the cell phone (Text me on my cell phone)
Say you love me, Say you love me
Then put me in a love song (Oh)

[Beyonce]
What you gonna do when somebody commences
Believe that he can do it better
Send me gifts and show me the romance
All this this and that, can you do better?
All I'm saying is love is what I'm looking for
If you wanna keep me, baby gotta love me more
If you really want me, like you say you want me
If you really need me, baby better come and say

[Chorus]
Say you love me, Say you love me
