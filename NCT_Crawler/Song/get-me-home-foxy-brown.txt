                        Yeah
 Firm biz, what it is? Blackstreet
 Na na, steady rise, peep this out
 Baby gotta get you home with me tonight
 Gotta get you home Hold up, let's take it from the top, I Fox
 Gets my swerve on, floss pure rocks
 In the six drop boo and it don't stop
 See money lookin' alright, yeah what up Pop 'Cross the room throwin' signals I'm throwin' 'em back
 Flirt-in cause I, digs you like that
 Peep baby boy style, hopin' we match
 You sent me Crown Royale with a note attached It said, "You look like the type that, know what you like"
 I could tell by the jewels you go for the ice
 Plus you wear the shoes well, the suits flows nice
 I don't like the notes too well, let's be more precise Meet me by the VIP let's pow-pow
 Whisper in my ear like, "Boo let's bounce now"
 I'm 'bout to say peace to my mans for you
 When it's all said and done I got plans for you, he said "Oh baby gotta get you home with me
 Gotta get you home with me tonight
 Oh baby, oh gotta get you home with me tonight
 C'mon, c'mon" At the bar high-post, frontin', I toast
 Gettin' my flirt on, playa, ain't nuttin'
 You tryin' to say the right words to get us out of here
 Jackpot, what he said, "It's bullshit in here" And his smile blind like the shine on his necklace
 Mind tellin' me no, body tellin' me exit
 Breasts said yes, give me more wet kisses, huh
 Twist my body like the exorcist, hey The way he licked his lips he was mackin'
 True thug passion, I'm like slow down before you crashin'
 Never mind him, he ain't thinkin' 'bout you
 Or the way we sex, on the villa up in Malibu Marry who? Daddy please
 I'm takin' it all from the stash to the keys
 So let me see, boo I'm bout to dead my mans for you
 When it's all said and done I got plans for you, he said "Oh baby, I need you want you in my life
 Gotta get you home with me tonight
 Gotta get you home with me tonight
 Oh baby, baby I need you
 Gotta get you home with me tonight right here" Grabbed me by the hand and led the way
 Outside of the club talkin' to Valet
 Mind started to stray, million miles away
 Contemplatin' goin' back to his crib to par-lay Jumped in the passenger seat, relaxed my feet
 As he threw on Blackstreet casually
 And we cruised the metro, on premium petrol
 I sized up my thighs and couldn't let go Ta-Ta's perkin', you're makin' me high
 Like Toni, work me, take me I'm hot
 I thought for a second and then my mind went
 Sex all around the car, isn't it ironic? Back to reality, the soul to soul
 Breathin' heavily but still in control
 Wants the shy girl role, put my hand on his leg
 With sex in his eyes, he turned and then, he said "Tonight baby
 Oh baby, c'mon c'mon Foxy c'mon
 Gotta get you home with me tonight
 Whatever you want me to do
 Oh baby, do it for you baby
 I need it in my life" Oh baby, gotta get you home tonight
 Oh baby, gotta get you home tonight
 Oh baby
