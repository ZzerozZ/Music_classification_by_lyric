                        Lean into my side
 Never felt alive
 Call the chants inside
 (We will wait for this, we will wait for this) Lean into my side
 Never felt alive
 Call the chants inside
 (We will wait for this, we will wait for this) Lean into my side
 Never felt alive
 Call the chants inside We will wait for this
 We will wait for this
 We will wait for this
 We will Lean into my side
 Never felt alive
 Call the chants inside
 (We will wait for this, we will wait for this) Lean into my side
 Never felt alive We will wait for this
 We will wait for this
 We will wait for this
 We will wait for this Lean into my side
 Never felt alive
 Call the chants inside Lean into my side
 Never felt alive
 Call the chants inside
 You see right through me
