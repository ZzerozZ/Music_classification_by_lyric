I don't follow rules and they don't like that
I was skippin' school to get my sack right
My bitch text me and ask why I don't text back
My dog got outta prison and went right back
These brand new, don't step on my Balenci's
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that (hitmaka)

Flooded out my wrist, a puddle drippin'
'42, I'm steady sippin'
Yeah, I'm on and I'm off that
These brand new, don't step on my Balenci's
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that

Flooded out my wrist, a puddle drippin'
'42, I'm steady sippin'
Yeah, I'm on and I'm off that
Yeah, yeah
I don't follow rules and they don't like that
Hit the club with wifey, brought a dime back
Hit the three twice and ran it right back
I'm only here tonight 'cause in the morning got a flight back

Talkin' it, but you ain't livin' like that
The porsche cost a hundred, this is twice that
Flooded all my diamonds, poland spring
Back in oakland I'm a king, I know and halsey is a ting
Yeah, 'rari detailed, there's not a speck of dust on it
I'ma get the bag, you can put some trust on it
Everything is new, so it's never rust on it
And her booty so big you could park a bus on it

Yee, yee!
These brand new, don't step on my Balenci's
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
Flooded out my wrist, a puddle drippin'
'42, I'm steady sippin'
Yeah, I'm on and I'm off that
These brand new, don't step on my Balenci's

I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
Flooded out my wrist, a puddle drippin'
'42, I'm steady sippin'
Yeah, I'm on and I'm off that
I don't follow rules and they don't like that
I was skippin' school to get my sack right
My bitch text me and ask why I don't text back
My dog got outta prison and went right back

28 on that scale, right back to the money
Stunting hard, show and tell like that
Yeah, versace table, fendi rug
And I got it out the mud
These brand new, don't step on my Balenci's
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
Flooded out my wrist, a puddle drippin'
'42, I'm steady sippin'

Yeah, I'm on and I'm off that
These brand new, don't step on my Balenci's
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
Flooded out my wrist, a puddle drippin'
'42, I'm steady sippin'
Yeah, I'm on and I'm off that
Red Christian Loubs, I rock designer shoes
Hunnid bands for my coupe, I speed and it go vroom

Baby hit my line because she see them stars in the roof
I'm up, now the whole gang got 24's on the coupes
Take a L, me, never, we in love, I lied
Foreign's what we ride, in the jet, we fly
If he sayin' he respect me, then it's likewise
Another man say he from another drive-by
I like the way she shake that cake, it's like a race

If she bad, I might take her out, not on a date
Say she boujee, she hit my phone, her nigga late
A 100k just off two shows spent that in a day
These brand new, don't step on my balenci's
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
Flooded out my wrist, a puddle drippin'

'42, I'm steady sippin'
Yeah, I'm on and I'm off that
These brand new, don't step on my balenci's
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
Flooded out my wrist, a puddle drippin'
'42, I'm steady sippin'
Yeah, I'm on and I'm off that
