                        Bài hát: Blossom - Milky Chance

[Verse 1]
'Cause I’m tired of all this talking
'Cause everything you hear is empty words
But who am I, oh to say this
'Cause everything you hear is just words, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You have to trust in someone, trust in someone, trust in someone
'Cause the truth is

[Chorus]
'Cause all I need, is to see you blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I need, is to see you blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out, blossom out, blossom out

[Verse 2]
And I'm tired of constant sorrow
'Cause everything you get, is just worse
So what's the point, in going somewhere
When everyone you see, is just nothing but confused

[Pre-Chorus]
You have to trust in someone, trust in someone, trust in someone
'Cause the truth is

[Chorus]
'Cause all I need, is to see you blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I need, is to see you blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out, blossom out, blossom out

[Outro]
'Cause all I need, is to see you blossom out blossom out blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out blossom out blossom out
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
                        
                    |
