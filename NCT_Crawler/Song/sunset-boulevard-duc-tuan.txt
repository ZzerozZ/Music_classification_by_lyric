                        Bài Hát: Sunset Boulevard - Đức Tuấn

Sure I came out here to make my name
Wanted my pool, my dose of fame
Wanted my parking space at Warner's.

But after a year, a one room hell
A murphy bed, a rancid smell
Wallpaper peeling at the corners.

Sunset Boulevard, twisting boulevard
Secretive and rich, a little scary
Sunset Boulevard, tempting boulevard
Waiting there to swallow the unwary.

Dreams are not enough to win a war
Out here they're always keeping score
Beneath the tan the battle rages.

Smile a rented smile, fill someone's glass
Kiss someone's wife, kiss someone's ass
We do whatever pays the wages.

Sunset Boulevard, headline boulevard
Getting here is only the beginning
Sunset Boulevard, jackpot boulevard
Once you've won you have to go on winning.

You think I've sold out?
Dead right I've sold out!
I just keep waiting for the right offer
Comfortable quarters, regular rations
24-hour Five Star room service.

And if I'm honest, I like the lady
I can't help being touched by her folly
I'm treading water, taking the money
Watching her sun set.

Well, I'm a writer!
L.A.'s changed a lot over the years
Since those brave gold rush pioneers
Came in their creaky covered wagons.

Far as they could go end of the line
Their dreams were yours
their dreams were mine
But in those dreams were hidden dragons.

Sunset Boulevard, frenzied boulevard
Swamped with every kind of false emotion
Sunset Boulevard, brutal boulevard
Just like you, we'll wind up in the ocean.

She was sinking fast, I threw a rope
Now I have suits and she has hope
It seemed an elegant solution
One day this must end, it isn't real
Still I'll enjoy a hearty meal
Before tomorrrow's execution.

Sunset Boulevard, ruthless boulevard
Destination for the stony-hearted
Sunset Boulevard, lethal boulevard
Everyone's forgotten how they started
Here on Sunset Boulevard.
