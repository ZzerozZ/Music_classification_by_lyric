                        Bài hát: When You Tell Me That You Love Me (Album Version) - Julio Iglesias, Dolly Parton

I want to call the stars
Down from the sky
I want to live a day
That never dies
I want to change the world
Only for you
All the impossible
I want to do

I want to hold you close
Under the rain
I want to kiss your smile
And feel the pain
I know what's beautiful
Looking at you
In a world of lies
You are the truth

And baby
Every time you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe
No matter where you are
And give you
Everything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me

I want to make you see
Just what I was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does
You walked into my life
To stop my tears
Everything's easy now
I have you here

And baby
Every time you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe
No matter where you are
And give you
Everything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me

In a world without you
I would always hunger
All I need is your love to make me stronger

And baby
Every time you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe
No matter where you are
And give you
Everything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me

You love me
When you tell me that you love me
