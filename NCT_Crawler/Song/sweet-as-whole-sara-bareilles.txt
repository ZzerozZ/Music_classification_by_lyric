                        Sometimes I can be perfectly sweet
 Got this sugary me all stuffed up in my sleeve
 And I'll talk of ponies and rainbows and things
 And I'm just who you want me to be
 Like most creatures down here on the ground
 I'm composed of the elements moving around
 But I grow and change and I shift and I switch
 And it turns out I'm actually kind of a bitch
 But that only happens when I get provoked
 By some piece of *** *** we all sadly know
 And I sit and I write while reminding you all
 That mean songs are still better than going postal

 That guy's an ***
 And that girl's a bitch
 Baby it's natural
 No getting away from it
 So sing it out with me
 And then let it go
 *** that guy he's just an ***

 I see I surprised you with some of my words
 And I know that surprises, while fun, still can hurt
 And I hate to think that I've ruined the day
 Of the dick and the queen of the high horse parade
 But I'm sick and tired of your poisonous ways
 You're a toxin wasting perfectly good space
 And I say what I think
 'Cause it's more economic than drugs or a drink

 That guy's an ***
 And that girl's a bitch
 Baby it's natural
 No getting away from it
 So sing it out with me
 And then let it go
 *** that guy he's just an ***

 And I won't let him in
 Under my skin
 You're a sad sack of ***
 It's pathetic
 Just a festering sore
 That will never be more than that
 If I don't let it

 That guy's an ***
 And that girl's a bitch
 Baby it's natural
 No getting away from it
 So sing it out with me
 And then let it go
 *** that guy he's just an ***
