Rock|

                        I tear on the leash
 That keeps me contained and controlled
 Let me go
 I wanna break free
 And bite my way out of this hole

 [Chorus:]
 One last hope
 To rise and break away
 Above the fading line
 Way beyond the ties that bind

 This I know
 The risk is worth the gain
 It's worth the sacrifice
 Way beyond the ties that bind

 I run but the chains
 Pull me right back to the floor
 You control
 I rattle the cage
 I won't be your slave anymore

 One last hope
 To rise and break away
 Above the fading line
 Way beyond the ties that bind

 This I know
 The risk is worth the gain
 It's worth the sacrifice
 Way beyond the ties that bind

 You broke me into pieces
 Don't tell me what to be
 Damn you all I'm gonna find my way!

 One last hope
 To rise and break away
 Above the fading line
 Way beyond the ties that bind

 This I know
 The risk is worth the gain
 It's worth the sacrifice
 Way beyond the ties that bind
                        
                    |
