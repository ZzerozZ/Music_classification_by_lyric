                        Bài hát : In For The Kill - La Roux

We can fight our desires, oo-oo
But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot, oo-oo
Whether we like it or not

They say we can love who we trust, oo-oo
But what is love without lust.
Two hearts with accurate devotion, oo-oo
What are feelings without emotions?

[Chorus:]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand [repeat 2x]

I had my hopes out on the line, oo-oo
Well they'll be ready for you in time.
If you leave them out too long, oo-oo
They'll be withered by the sun.

Full stops and exclamation marks, oo-oo
My heart stopped moving 'fore I start.
How far can you send emotions? oo-oo
Can this bridge cross the ocean?

[Chorus]

Let's go to war to make peace
Let's be cold to create heat
I hope in darkness we can see
And you're not blinded by the light from me

Woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo

[Chorus]
