                        Take her phone and 'er ID
 Can't post me on IG
 Know them thots they be creep
 Tryna catch a selfie while I'm asleep
 Go to far you need a passport
 See 'em shots coming got a glass quart
 Thots try to camcorder
 That's a long shot I'm sure from headquarters Can't trust thots
 Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots) (hey girl!)
 Then she come running to my car (thots)
 She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
 And you can't trust thots
 Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
 She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
 She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile A thot is a girl that look for bottles as soon as she come in the club (in the club)
 You can find her at my table flirting with the ballers tryna go for a cup (for a cup)
 Crazy part shorty bad as *** (***)
 Doing squats all day working on her butt (butt)
 She know that I'll make a nigga go nuts
 That's what she want She ain't tryna pay for anything if anything
 She tryna get a wedding ring
 But me and my niggas ain't no cuffing no nothing (nothing)
 And her favorite thing to hear a dude (say is)
 You might get a pair of nice shoes and a bag (hey girl!)
 Money ain't nothing baby I'll spend it fast on you (you)
 Baby I'll spend it fast on you That's when I found out that you can't trust thots
 Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
 Then she come running to my car (thots)
 She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
 And you can't trust thots
 Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
 She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
 She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile A thot is a girl that look for sparkle as soon as she come in the club (club)
 You can spot her up at the bar until she see them lights
 Then she coming on over here with us
 Ain't no shame in her game
 She bring her friends too and
 They be tryna act like they not with her but they be drinking too She ain't tryna pay for anything if anything
 She tryna get a wedding ring
 But me and my niggas ain't no cuffing no nothing (nothing)
 And her favorite thing to hear a dude (say is)
 You might get a pair of nice shoes and a bag
 Money ain't nothing baby I'll spend it fast on you
 Baby I'll spend it fast on you That's when I found out that you can't trust thots
 Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
 Then she come running to my car (thots)
 She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
 And you can't trust thots
 Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
 She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
 She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile (Thots be like) I need nice shoes and a bag
 Need a dough boy with it bad
 (Thots be like) I got the best pussy and the best head
 Need my boobs and my ass did
 (Thots be like) I know you got smoke and some drink
 Tonight I'm goin hard in the paint
 (Thots be like) If you love me like he say he did
 He'll move me where he say he live You can't trust thots
 Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
 Then she come running to my car (thots)
 She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
 And you can't trust thots
 Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
 She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
 She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
 (Can't trust thots)
