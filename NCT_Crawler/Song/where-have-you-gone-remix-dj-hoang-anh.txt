                        Bài hát: Where Have You Gone (Remix) - DJ Hoàng Anh

I look around, alone 
Where have you gone? 
You haven't told me anything, 
So I ask you, where have you gone? 

I've look around, alone 
Where have you gone? 
You haven't told me anything, 
So I ask you, where have you gone? 

Where have you gone? 
So tell me where have you gone? 
Where have you gone? 
So tell me where where have you gone? 

The night is here 
The room is dark, 
Where is the light that shines on me right now 
So I ask you, where have you gone? 

Where have you gone? 
So tell me where where have you gone?
                        
                    |
