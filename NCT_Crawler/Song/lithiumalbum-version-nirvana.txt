                        I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
 They're in my head
 I'm so ugly but that's ok, 'cause so are you
 We've broke our mirrors
 Sunday morning is everyday for all I care
 I'm not scared
 Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found god

 I'm so lonely
 That's ok, I shaved my head
 No, I'm not sad
 And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
 I'm not sure, I'm so excited
 I can't wait to meet you there
 And I don't' care, I'm so horny
 That's ok, my will is good

 I like it, I'm not gonna crack
 I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
 I love you, I'm not gonna crack
 I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
 I like it, I'm not gonna crack
 I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
 I love you, I'm not gonna crack
 I killed you, I'm not gonna crack

 I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
 They're in my head
 I'm so ugly but that's ok, 'cause so are you
 We've broke our mirrors
 Sunday morning is everyday for all I care
 I'm not scared
 Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found god

 I like it, I'm not gonna crack
 I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
 I love you, I'm not gonna crack
 I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
 I like it, I'm not gonna crack
 I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
 I love you, I'm not gonna crack
 I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
