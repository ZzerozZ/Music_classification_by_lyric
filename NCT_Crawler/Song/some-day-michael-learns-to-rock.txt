                        In my search for freedom 
And peace of mind 
I've left the memories behind 
Want to start a new life 
But it seems to be rather absurd 
When I know the truth 
Is that I always think of you 

Someday someway 
Together we will be baby 
I will take and you will take your time 
We'll wait for our fate 
'cause' nobody owns us baby 
We can shake we can shake the rock 

Try to throw the picture out of my mind 
Try to leave the memories behind 
Here by the ocean 
Wave's carry voices from you 
Do you know the truth 
I am thinking of you too 

Someday someway 
Together we will be baby 
I will take and you will take your time 
We'll wait for our fate 
'cause' nobody owns us baby 
We can shake we can shake the rock 

The love we had together 
Just fades away in time 
And now you've got your own world 
And I guess I've got mine 
But the passion that you planted 
In the middle of my heart 
Is a passion that will never stop
                        
                    |
