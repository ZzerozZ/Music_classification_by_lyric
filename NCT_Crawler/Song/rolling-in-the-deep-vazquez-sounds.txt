                        There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark.

Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
See how I'll leave, with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.

There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark.

The scars of your love, remind me of us.
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't feeling

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
And you played it to the beat

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love, remind you of us.
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't feeling

We could have had it all 

Rolling in the deep


You had my heart inside your hand
And you played it to the beat

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul threw every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(I wish you never gonna miss you)
We could have had it all
We could have had it all (I wish you never gonna miss you)
It all(3 times)

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
And you played it to the beat
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
                        
                    |
