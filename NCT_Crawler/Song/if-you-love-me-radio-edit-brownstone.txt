                        Ooh yeah, yoo hoo...

 I don't wanna rain on this parade
 But I'm starting to question the love that was made
 I'm not looking for just an affair
 I want a love that is based on truth not just dare


 2-You will not hurt my pride
 If right now you decide
 That you are not ready to settle down
 But if you want my heart
 Then it's time that you start
 To act like you're mine in the light and the dark

 1-If you love me, say it
 If you trust me, do it
 If you want me, show it
 If you need me, prove it

 (repeat 1)

 You see now actions speak louder than words
 So don't just say things that I've already heard
 Don't want your body without your soul
 I don't want a love who will come here and go


 (rpt 2, 1, 1...1)
 Oh I, Oh I, I wanna touch you baby
 And spread my love all around you, honey
 And if you come, you gotta show
 True love to share...

 Oh baby, yeah baby, oh baby
