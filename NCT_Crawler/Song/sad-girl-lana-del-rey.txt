                        Bài hát: Sad Girl - Lana Del Rey

Being a mistress on the side,
It might not appeal to fools like you.
We been around on the side,
Wanna be somethin' you would do.

But you haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen him.

He's got the fire and he walks with it,
He's got the fire and he talks with it.

His bonnie on the side, bonnie on the side,
Makes me a sad, sad girl.
His money on the side, money on the side,
Makes me a sad, sad girl.

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl.
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl.

Bein' a bad bitch on the side,
Might not appeal to fools like you.
We been around while he gets high,
It might not be somethin' you would do.

But you haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen him.

He's got the fire and he walks with it,
He's got the fire and he talks with it.

His bonnie on the side, bonnie on the side,
Makes me a sad, sad girl.
His money on the side, money on the side,
Makes me a sad, sad girl.

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl.
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl.

Watch what you say to me,
Careful who you're talkin' to.
Watch what you say to me,
Careful who you're talkin' to.

I'm on fire, baby, I'm on fire.

He's got the fire and he walks with it,
He's got the fire and he talks with it.

His bonnie on the side, bonnie on the side,
Makes me a sad, sad girl.
His money on the side, money on the side,
Makes me a sad, sad girl.

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl.
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl.
I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl.
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl.
