                        Song: This Is The Life - Amy MacDonald

Oh, the wind whistles down the cold dark street tonight
 And the people they were dancing to the music vibe
 And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
 While the shy tormented youth sit way over there
 And the songs they get louder each one better than before 
And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
 And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
 Where you gonna go? 
Where you gonna go?
 Where you gonna sleep tonight?
 And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
 And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
 Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
 Where you gonna sleep tonight?
 Where you gonna sleep tonight? 
So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four
 And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
 But nobody's in and nobody's home 'til four
 So you're sitting there with nothing to do
 Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
 And where you're gonna go?
 And where you're gonna sleep tonight? 
And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
 And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
 Where you gonna go? 
Where you gonna go?
 Where you gonna sleep tonight? 
And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
 And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
 Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
 Where you gonna sleep tonight? 
Where you gonna sleep tonight? 
And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
 And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
 Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
 Where you gonna sleep tonight? 
And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
 And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
 Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
 Where you gonna sleep tonight?
 And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
 And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
 Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
 Where you gonna sleep tonight? 
And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
 And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
 Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
 Where you gonna sleep tonight? Where you gonna sleep tonight?
