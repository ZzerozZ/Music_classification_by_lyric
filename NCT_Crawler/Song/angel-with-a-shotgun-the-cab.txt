                        "Angel With A Shotgun"

(I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun,
An angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun..)

Get out your guns, battles begun,
are you a saint, or a sinner?
If loves a fight, than I shall die,
with my heart on a trigger.

They say before you start a war,
you better know what you're fighting for.
Well baby, you are all that I adore,
if love is what you need, a soldier I will be.

I'm an angel with a shotgun,
fighting til' the wars won,
I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
Don't you know you're everything I have?
..and I, wanna live, not just survive, tonight.

Sometimes to win, you've got to sin,
don't mean I'm not a believer.
..and major Tom, will sing along.
Yeah, they still say I'm a dreamer.

They say before you start a war,
you better know what you're fighting for.
Well baby, you are all that I adore,
if love is what you need, a soldier I will be.

I'm an angel with a shotgun,
fighting til' the wars won,
I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
Don't you know you're everything I have?
..and I, wanna live, not just survive, tonight.

ooooohhhhhhhh, ooooooohhhhh whoa whoa oooh whoa

I'm an angel with a shotgun..
fighting til' the wars won..
I don't care if heaven won't take me back..

I'm an angel with a shotgun,
fighting til' the wars won,

I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
Don't you know you're everything I have?
(I'm an angel with a shotgun)
..and I, want to live, not just survive, tonight.
(Live, not just survive)

..and I'm gonna hide, hide, hide my wings tonight.

Well baby, you are all that I adore,
if love is what you need, a soldier I will be.
