                        Bài hát: Unravel (English Cover) - Nightcore

Oh, won't you tell me? Please just tell me. 

Explain how this should work. 

Well now who could it be, that lives inside of me? 
I'm broken, lying helpless, shattered 
Surrounded by the world 

And yet, you're smiling bright 
Completely blind to life 

My ruptured lungs; they were left this way 
For once, I'm out of breath. 
The truth I seek, never felt so bleak but, 
I maintain my depth 

Freeze 

I'm breakable; 
Unbreakable 
I'm shaking yet, 
Unshakable 
Until the day that you find me. 

I'll stand here, 
Existing and feeling wretched* existence 
Consuming life-force til I grow distant 
Don't bother searching for somebody like me. 
A fading no one. 
I don't want to hurt you, It's not my nature. 
A monster born from dusk to dawn can't be your saviour 
Remember the 'me', the way I used to be. 

As who I still should be. 

The isolation spreads and tears 
Those happy /days, pierce into me 
These lonely memories cease to care 
They spread throughout my history 

I’ll never move 
I’ll never lose 
I’ll never move 
I’ll never lose 
I’ll never move 
I’ll never lose you. 
Unraveling the world 

At once, I start changing, 
Yet everything’s remaining 
These lives I felt would join as one, 
They fade away before they’ve begun. 
I’m breakable; unbreakable 
I’m shaking yet, unshakable 
Until these hands “contaminate” you 

I’ll stand here existing and feeling wretched existence 
Consuming life-force til I grow distant 
Don't bother searching for somebody like me. A fading no one. 
This lonely space, held into place by someone crazy 
Shall melt away like dawn to day as things get hazy 
So please think of me, the way I used to be. 

As who I really should be 

So don’t forget me, 
You can’t forget me 
You won’t forget me 
Please don’t forget me. 

With changing inside I’m completely paralyzed 
Remaining corrupt as I wish for paradise 

Remember the 'me', the way I used to be. 

Oh, won’t you tell? Oh, please just tell... 
Well now who could it be, that lives inside of me?
                        
                    |
