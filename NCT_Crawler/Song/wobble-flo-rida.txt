                        Bài hát: Wobble - Flo Rida

Every time you come around 
I'm like ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby 
When I see you break it down 
I like you do, baby, you do, baby 
Papa told me, "Boy 
Don't ever let down your guard" 
But when you touch my hand and talk that talk 
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk 

Wobble in my... wobble in my... 
Wobble in my... wobble in my... 
When you touch my hand and talk that talk 
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk 

It's like my head's back, been drinkin' out the bottle, I swallow 
Some strong drank but really just my motto, she lotto 
Jackpot, grand prize, champion franchise 
Born ready and she get it right there on time 
Early A.M., breakfast after the mayhem 
Baby cause they don't make them like you, I hope that you hate them 
Black [?], I keep 'em twerkin' 
They're workin', that's why they're perfect, go 'head and purchase 

Girl it's on me, yeah it's my dime 
Damn if I'm wrong, yeah it's alright 
When you go down, down in my mind 
Do what you want, that's what I like 

Every time you come around 
I'm like ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby 
When I see you break it down 
Like you do, baby, you do, baby 
Papa told me, "Boy 
Don't ever let down your guard" 
But when you touch my hand and talk that talk 
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk 

Wobble, wobble, satisfaction, my model 
Show me you'll lead the way, and maybe I'll follow 
Promise you ecstasy, long as you're here with me 
No promise at all, my love be guaranteed 
Cause baby I'll hit the throttle, make our way to the grotto 
Private dancin' in there and Playboy mansion tomorrow 
It's all free, cause I agree you make 'em weak 
Talkin' 'bout my knees, and the thing you need, girl 

Girl it's on me, yeah it's my dime 
Damn if I'm wrong, yeah it's alright 
When you go down, down in my mind 
Do what you want, that's what I like 

Every time you come around 
I'm like ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby 
When I see you break it down 
Like you do, baby, you do, baby 
Papa told me, "Boy 
Don't ever let down your guard" 
But when you touch my hand and talk that talk 
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk 

Work, work, work, work, work with it 
Don't stop, don't, don't stop, get it 
When you touch my hand and talk that talk 
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk 

Wobble in my... wobble in my... 
Wobble in my... wobble in my... 
When you touch my hand and talk that talk 
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk
