                        Do you think you love me..... Ooo we! 
I THINK I LOVE YOU! 

I'm sleeping 
And right in the middle of a good dream 
Then all at once I wake up 
From something that keeps knocking at my brain 
Before I go insane 
I hold my pillow to my head 
And spring up in my bed 
Screaming out the words I dread .... 
"I think I love you!" (I think I love you) 

This morning, I woke up with this feeling 
I didn't know how to deal with 
And so I just decided to myself 
I'd hide it to myself 
And never talk about it 
And did not go and shout it 
When you walked into the room ..... 
"I think I love you!" (I think I love you) 

I think I love you 
So what am I so afraid of? 
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of 
A love there is no cure for 
I think I love you 
Isn't that what life is made of? 
Though it worries me to say 
I've never felt this way 

Believe me 
You really don't have to worry 
I only want to make you happy 
And if you say 
Hey, go away, I will 
But I think better still 
I'd better stay around and love you 
Do you think I have a case? 
Let me ask you to your face 
Do you think you love me? 

I think I love you 
So what am I so afraid of? 
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of 
A love there is no cure for 
I think I love you 
Isn't that what life is made of? 
Though it worries me to say 
I've never felt this way 

I don't know what I'm up against 
I don't know what it's all about 
I've go so much to think about 
Hey!I think I love you! 
So what am I so afraid of? 
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of 
A love there is no cure for 
I think I love you 
Isn't that what life is made of? 
Though it worries me to say 
I've never felt this way 

I think I love you! 
So what am I so afraid of? 
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of 
A love there is no cure for 
I think I love you 
Isn't that what life is made of? 
Though it worries me to say 
I've never felt this way
