Rock|

                        Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
 I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
 Now my only company's a half full glass of wine
 You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
 You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge It's been so long since I held your hand
 You don't know how hard it can be I thank god I've been blessed with a patient mind
 Because what I want to happen won't happen in a very long time
 Now my only company's a half full glass of wine It's been so long since I held your hand
 You don't know how hard it can be
                        
                    |
