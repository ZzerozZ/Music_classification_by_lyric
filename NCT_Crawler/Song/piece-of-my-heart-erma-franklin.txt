                        Didn't I make you feel
 Like you were the only man
 And didn't I give you everything
 That a woman possibly can
 Each time I tell myself I think I've had enough
 Well I'm gonna show you baby that a woman can be tough
 So come on, come on, come on and

 Take it
 Take another little piece of my heart now baby
 I know you will
 Break it
 Break another little piece of my heart now baby
 'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good

 You're out on the street lookin' good
 Baby deep down in your heart you know that it ain't right
 No you'll never hear me cryin'
 You know I cry all the time
 Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
 You hold me in your arms and I start singin' once again
 So come on, come on, come on and

 Take it
 Take another little piece of my heart now baby
 I know you will
 Break it
 Break another little piece of my heart now baby
 'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good

 Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
 You hold me in your arms and I start singin' once again
 So come on, come on, come on

 Take it
 Take another little piece of my heart now baby
 I know you will
 Break it
 Break another little piece of my heart now baby
 'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so
