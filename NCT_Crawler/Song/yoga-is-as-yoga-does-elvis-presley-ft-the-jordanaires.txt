                        Well, I can see that you and yoga will never do Yoga is as yoga does, there's no in between
 You're either with it on the ball or you've blown the scene
 I can see it lookin' at you, you just can't get settled
 How can I even move, twistin' like a pretzel? Yoga is as yoga does there's no in between
 You're either with it all the way
 Or you've blown the scene
 Or you've blown the scene Come on, come on, untwist my legs, pull my arms a lot
 How did I get so tied up in this yoga knot?
 You tell me just how I can take this yoga serious
 When all it ever gives to me is a pain in my posteriors Yoga is as yoga does there's no in between
 You're either with it all the way
 Or you've blown the scene
 Or you've blown the scene Stand upside down on your head, feet against the wall
 A simple yoga exercise done by one and all
 Now cross your eyes and hold your breath, look just like a clown
 Yoga's sure to catch you if you come falling down Yoga is as yoga does there's no in between
 You're either with it all the way
 Or you've blown the scene
 Or you've blown the scene Yoga is as yoga does there's no in between
 You're either with it all the way
 Or you've blown the scene
 Or you've blown the scene
