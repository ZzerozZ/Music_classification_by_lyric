                        Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit Of...)

Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo No 5

One, two, three four, five
Everybody in the car so come on let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner,
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna
Beerbust like I had last week
I must stay deep 'cause talk is a cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know they're gettin' sweeter
So what can I do I really beg you my Lord
To me flirtin' it's just like a sport
Anything fly it's all good let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

Mambo No. 5!

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man
Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound put your hands an the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this then you doin' it right

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

Trumpet, the Trumpet!
Mambo No. 5!

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man
