                        [Verse:]
 This house is not a home to you
 But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
 There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
 Cause I see you’re here to stay
 Should of known to pick my fate

 Ooh
 [Chorus:]
 I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
 (To let you in my)
 To let you in my home
 (Now you know where I sleep)
 Now you know where I sleep
 (Never felt so damn weak)

 [Verse 2:]
 Hey there lonely girl
 Did you have to tell your friends
 About the way I got you screaming my name
 Did you have to tell the world
 Now your girls all wanna ***
 Girl you could've been the one
 Now gotta change my numbers twice a month
 When you could have simply kept me on the down low

 [Chorus:]

 [Verse 3:]
 Baby if I knew you'd be living in my sheets
 I wouldn't have shown you any love
 I would have left you in the club
 You said you don't belong
 You keep saying there's no one
 And there's no where to go
 But who keeps calling on your phone?
 I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong

 [Chorus:]
 (Oh baby)
                        
                    |
