                        Bài Hát:King Of Sorrow
Trình Bày:Sade
Album:Lovers Rock
I’m crying everyone’s tears
And there inside our private war
I died the night before
And all of these remnants of joy and disaster
What am I suppose to do
I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
But nothing would change, nothing would change at all
It’s just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothing’s any good
The DJ’s playing the same song
I have so much to do
I have to carry on
I wonder if this grief will ever let me go
I feel like I am the king of sorrow, yeah
The king of sorrow
I suppose I could just walk away
Will I disappoint my future if I stay
It’s just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothing’s any good
The DJ’s playing the same song
I have so much to do
I have to carry on
I wonder will this grief ever be gone
Will it ever go
I’m the king of sorrow, yeah
The king of sorrow
I’m crying everyone’s tears
I have already paid for all my future sins
There’s nothing anyone 
Can say to take this away
It’s just another day and nothing’s any good
I’m the king of sorrow, yeah
King of sorrow
I’m the king of sorrow, yeah
King of sorrow
