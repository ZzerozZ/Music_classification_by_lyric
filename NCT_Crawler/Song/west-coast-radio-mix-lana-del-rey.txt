                        Bài hát: West Coast (Radio Mix) - Lana Del Rey

Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling
Like it all could happen that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment
You for the moment, it's true, it's true

You're feeling hard to push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive I'm a-lush
Your love, your love, our love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock and roll groupies
And you got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, our love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
