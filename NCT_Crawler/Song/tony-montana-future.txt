                        [Chorus]
 Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
 Check up on my ears
 Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
 I'm 'bout to cop the Porsche
 Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
 You leave me no choice, take 'em to
 Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
 I come straight from the east, where niggas split your canteloupe
 Just tell me where you wanna meet, I'm coming with a gang of dope
 My cigar full of loud
 I'm laced up to the *** flo'
 The Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
 I do the whole dash, dropping all cash
 Gutta to the death of me I'm sticking to the recipe
 Plug, deal with Columbians, I know Sosa
 All I got is my balls and my word, *** the Roaches
 Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofa's
 The money got me geeked, like I took a hit of coka
 My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused [Chorus] On the hood you see the Stallion
 Passenger a stallion
 Niggas getting nervous
 I'm passing out the Valium
 I suggest you pop it
 But please don't get too sleepy
 Used to have them bitches twirkin'
 Up in 400 West Peach tree
 Bet ya those same hoes'll see me
 Be like that's how you feeling
 Used to stay up after twelve
 Now your worth like twelve million
 Boy you did, boy you did it
 You did the unexpected
 I say *** the unexpected
 I just did what I projected
 I swear young women are lost these days
 While older women dig me
 *** women that knew Biggie so
 We really ain't no biggie
 It's just OVO and XO and freebandz of committee
 And shout out to Toronto
 Bitch I'm Tony in my city [Chorus] Another shot of Quelo
 She be comin' back fo peso's
 When ya plugged in with Pedro, it's hard for hoes to let go
 See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga I'll split yo tato
 Ain't nothin' 'bout me ordinary, I come with the yayo
 I move like A Mob boss, it's gon take an army
 The world is mine nigga u get it if u want it
 You ***in with me you'll move to Alaska by the mornin
 You want me to be the bad guy, ok it's on then
 Champagne spillin', crabcakes everywhere
 My white bitch trippin she say ain't playin' fair
 I'm bout to cop a tiger and put it in the castle
 Freebandz a company so nigga it don't matter though [Chorus]
