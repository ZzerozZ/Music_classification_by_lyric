                        Now this melody's a healer
 It's got my baby in a fever
 And I hope it gets the better of you With this Morricone music
 There's no way you can refute it
 But girl you ain't got nothing to lose Aye, aye, aye girl, oh, oh, oh
 It's not who you know
 When I'm what you know
 Aye, aye, aye
 Just come and go with me Aye, aye, aye, girl gone, gone, gone
 Don't want a room full of snakes
 If the lights are on and
 Aye, aye, aye
 Just come and go with me Will the angel or the devil die in ecstasy
 There's something coming over you come over me
 Falling in love is never easy
 'Cause they're so good I'm so bad, so let's get ugly Now she's a gentle mental, got perversions detrimental
 But there's times I just don't know what to do
 She's all grown up and sexy and I know she's not my baby
 But man, I ain't got nothing to lose Aye, aye, aye girl oh, oh, oh
 It's not who you know
 When I'm what you know
 Aye, aye, aye
 Just come and go with me Aye, aye, aye, girl gone, gone, gone
 Don't want a room full of snakes
 If the lights are on and
 Aye, aye, aye
 Just come and go with me Will the angel or the devil die in ecstasy?
 There's something coming over you come over me
 Falling in love is never easy
 'Cause they're so good, I'm so bad, so let's get ugly It's never easy
 The good, the bad
 The good, the bad
 Good bad, good bad
 Let's get ugly Will the angel or the devil die in ecstasy?
 There's something coming over you come over me
 Falling in love is never easy
 'Cause they're so good, I'm so bad, so let's get ugly
