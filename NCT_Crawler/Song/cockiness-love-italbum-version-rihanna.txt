                        Suck my cockiness
 Lick my persuasion
 Eat my words
 And swallow your pride down, down

 Place my wants and needs
 Over your resistance
 And then you come around
 You come around
 You come around

 I want you to be my s** slave
 Anything that I desire
 Be one with my femin-ay
 Set my whole body on fire

 They mad at Rihanna game
 Taking over your empire
 She may be the queen of hearts
 But I'm a better queen to your body parts

 No one can do ya
 The way that I do
 Boy I wa-a-ant
 (Youuuuuu)
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it

 Suck my cockiness
 Lick my persuasion
 Eat my words
 And swallow your pride down, down

 Place my wants and needs
 Over your resistance
 And then you come around
 You come around
 You come around

 I can be your dominatrix
 Just submit to my every order
 Enter my diamond matrix
 If you want my golden flower

 Make me your priority
 There's nothing above my pleasure
 She may be the queen of hearts
 But I'm a better queen to your body parts

 No one can do ya
 The way that I do
 Boy I wa-a-ant
 (Youuuuuuuu)
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it

 Homie don't beat it like a bullet
 Beat my drum drum
 Like a drum line boogie
 (I love it when you)
 Dive head first if you wanna
 Sing to my body
 Hold me tight mister lover
 (I love it when you)
 Do it like I do it
 Like I said
 Keep it up, boy
 We can do this all day
 Be my Harlem
 And me St. Tropez
 Never found nobody
 That will do it this way

 No one can do ya
 The way that I do
 Boy I wa-a-ant
 (Youuuuuu)
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it, I love it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it
 I love it when you eat it
