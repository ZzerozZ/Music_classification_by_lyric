Yeah!
Ha
Yeah!
Ha

Woke up a little too late this morning
But I think I'll be okay
I'll be okay
Damn, my car still smells like marijuana
My mom is gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Traffic's backed up from corner to corner
So I guess I'll hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all the stress off my shoulders
Gonna have a good day
A good day

Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid *** that young kids do
It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid *** that young kids do

No I've never really been the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
My mistakes
You were there when times were at their darkest
Always showing me the way
Lead the way
Your love seems to cut me deep, the sharpest
You'll always have a part of me
A part of me
Losing you has always been the hardest
I wish it were the old days (oh I wish it were the old days)

'Cause I was eighteen
And I still lived with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours were more understanding
I never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
When we did all the stupid *** that young kids do
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid *** that young kids do

It's me and you
You
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
You
Just me and you
You
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey...hey

Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid *** that young kids do
It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid *** that young kids do

It's me and you, ooh, ooh
Noooo....
Just me and you, ooh, ooh
