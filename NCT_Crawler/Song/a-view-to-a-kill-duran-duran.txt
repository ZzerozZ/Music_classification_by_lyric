                        Meeting you, with a view to a kill
 Face to face in secret places, feel the chill
 Night fall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
 Still oversea, could it be the whole world opening wide
 A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
 The weekend's why Until we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
 Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
 Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
 Dance into the fire Choice for you, is the view to a kill
 Between the shades, assassination's standing still
 The first crystal tears, fall as snowflakes on your body
 First time in years, to drench you skin with lovers rosy stain
 A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
 A chance to die But can we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
 Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
 Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
 Dance into the fire, when all we see is the view to a kill
                        
                    |
