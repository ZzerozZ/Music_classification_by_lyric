                        Bài hát: How Deep Is Your Love - Take That

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch my hand in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep you warm in your love then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really need to learn 'coz we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
And know you are the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You are my savior when I fall

And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really need to learn 'coz we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

You're the light
You're my life

And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really need to learn 'coz we're living in a world of fools
Their breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

So, how deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
So, how deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
