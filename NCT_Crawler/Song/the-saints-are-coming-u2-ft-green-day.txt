There is a house in New Orleans
they call the Rising Sun
And it’s been a house to many a poor boy
and God, I know I’m one

I cried to my daddy on the telephone
how long now?
Until the clouds unroll and you come down on the light wind
will the shadows still remain since your descent
your descent

I cried to my daddy on the telephone
How long now
Until the clouds unroll and you come home
The line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent
Your descent

Ho, Cha, Hey

The saints are coming
The saints are coming

I say no matter how I try
I realize there’s no reply

The saints are coming
The saints are coming

I say no matter how I try
I realize there’s no reply
......

A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief
How long now
Until a weather change condemns belief
How long now
When the night watchman is in the fleet
What's wrong now?

Ho, Cha, Hey

The saints are coming
The saints are coming

I say no matter how I try
I realize there’s no reply

The saints are coming
The saints are coming

I say no matter how I try
I realize there's no reply

I say no matter how I try
I realize there's no reply

I say no matter how I try
I realize there's no reply
