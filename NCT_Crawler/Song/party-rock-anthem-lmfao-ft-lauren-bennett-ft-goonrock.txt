Party rock
Yeah
Whoa!
Let's go!

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (yeah)
And we gonna make you lose your mind (whoa!)
Everybody just have a good time (clap!)

Party rock is in the house tonight (oh)
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it baby!)
And we gonna make you lose your mind (yeah)
We just wanna see you... shake that!

In the club party rock, lookin' for your girl,
She on my jock (huh) non-stop when we're in the spot
Booty move the weight like she owns the block
Where I drank I gots to know
Tight jeans, tattoos cause I'm rock and roll
Half black half white, domino
Gain the money Oprah Doe!

Yo!
I'm running through these hoes like Drano
I got that devilish flow rock and roll no halo
We party rock yeah! that's the crew that I'm repping
On a rise to the top no lead in our Zeppelin
Hey!

Party rock is in the house tonight (whoa)
Everybody just have a good time (yeah)
And we gonna make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time

Let's go

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it baby!)
And we gonna make you lose your mind
We just wanna see you... shake that!

Every day I'm shuffling
Shuffling shuffling

Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We get money, don't be mad, now stop – hating's bad

One more shot for us
(Another round)
Please fill up my cup
(Don't mess around)
We just wanna see
(You shake it now)
Now you home with me
(You're naked now)

Get up get down put your hands up to the sound [3x]
Put your hands up to the sound [2x]
Get up [9x]
Put your hands up to the sound, to the sound
Put your hands up! [4x]

Party rock is in the house tonight (put your hands up!)
Everybody just have a good time (put your hands up!)
And we gonna make you lose your mind (put your hands up!)
Everybody just have a good good good time

Oh! Oh! (Put your hands up)
Oh! Oh! (Time to fill it now!)
Oh! Oh! (Put your hands up)
Oh! Oh! (Put your hands up)

Shake that!
Every day I'm shuf-f-f-ling

Put your put your
Put your put your (yeah yeah)
Put your put your (whoa!)
Put your put your
Put your hands up
Your hands up
Put your hands up

Every day I'm shuffling
