                        Bài hát: Believer (Imagine Dragons Cover) - J.Fla

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses

Write down my poems for the few
That looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
'Til it broke up and it rained down
And rained down

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
