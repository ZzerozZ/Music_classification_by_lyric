All We Know Is Falling

When we get home i know we wont be home at all
this place we live
it is not where we belong
and i miss who we were
and the town we could call our own
going back to get away after everything has changed
everything has changed(again 3)

so we stand here now
and no one knows us at all
i wont get used to this
i wont get used to being gone
and going back wont feel the same if we arent staying
and going back to get away after everything has changed
everything has changed(again 3)
.......

its taking up our time again
go back we cant, go back at all
its taking up our time again
go back we cant, go back at all
its taking up our time again
go back we cant, go back at all
its taking up our time
its taking up our time
cause you remind me of a time
when we were so alive
do you remember that?
do you remember that?
