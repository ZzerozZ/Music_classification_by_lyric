                        Aey whassup my nig?
 ***, just chillin', what's happenin'?
 *** nuttin', whatchu up to?
 ***, not too much, aey you ain't seen that nigga Snoop?
 Man hell naw, I been callin' that nigga since Starsky and Hutch
 I ain't fin' to call that nigga no more man
 Oh like that?
 Man f'real man, I ain't buyin' that new album either
 I'ma download that mother***er for free
 Let that nigga know when I see him man
 ***, there he go right there I don't say much, I don't say "Alize", say, no I don't say "Dutch"
 Keep yo' hands off until I say, okay touch
 I never come off tacky, I'm a boss exactly
 I'm like the slick suit Snooper fly Versace Conversation flashy, y'all niggaz can't match me
 I talk to you slow, so your game can roll
 Take advice from a player, don't love her just play her
 Boy I never could dare, to pay double the fare
 Man I swear to God it's gon' be some trouble in here
 Before I pay that bitch, I'm like a bossy hog
 Half dog, half gorilla, bitch Donkey Kong Niggaz thirst for hoes, I got a thirst to ball
 Tryin' to knock a pimp's hustle, be the first to fall
 Fuckin' with a hundred fifty, whole can of vodka
 Mixed with gang bang, got a program like Poppa I'ma do you a favor, let this pimpin' save ya
 Leave that bitch alone, the homies call her Ms. Behavior
 Boy you move too fast, done too much talkin'
 I'm too much walkin' to one who keep hoes hawkin' Don't *** with Snoop too much 'cause he goes off when
 Niggaz mouth too much, so please no flossin'
 I step up quicker, 'cause the game don't pause
 I gotta stay sucka free, 'cause it ain't no laws
 Dig this y'all That's the bidness man, step my game up up in this man
 Long hours hard minutes man, with this hustle on splendid man
 He gave perfect attendance man 'Cause I'm a boss
 Yea, real bossy like and sometimes flossy
 And if you ***in' with that I had to tell you the truth homey but you got mad
 Yea I hurt yo' feelings, *** it! It's too damn bad
 I'm a major player, I got major game
 I might floss a different bitch, but the pimpin' the same I ain't got time for no haters, I lay 'em flat on they back
 I'm from the Dogg Pound homey, I don't *** with them cats
 I *** with, niggaz, who be bustin' them shots
 I'm talkin' Long Beach, Inglewood, Compton, Watts Close your chops, I knows your spots
 Keep talkin' nigga I'll expose your knots
 You ain't ready for Daddy, boy I do this for fun
 It's like you versus Kobe ballin' one on one
 You ain't got no chance, you ain't got no fans
 I kick the *** out you punk, look Momma no hands
 I'm not a holy roller but I pray so hard
 Help me, I'm sendin' these bitch niggaz straight to God *** I'm too damn grown, conversation is short
 While your talk is funny, Jack I talk with money
 Keep the chain on bling, the rock is sunny
 For you smart mouthed bitches I ain't that dummy That's the bidness man, step my game up up in this man
 Long hours hard minutes mane, with this hustle on splendid man
 He gave perfect attendance man That's the bidness man, step my game up up in this man
 Long hours hard minutes man, with this hustle on splendid man
 He gave perfect attendance man That's the bidness, that's the bidness
 That's the bidness, can I get a witness?
 Yea, that's the bidness, yea, say what?
 Yea that's the bidness, can I get a witness?
