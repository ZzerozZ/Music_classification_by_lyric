                        I love to watch a woman dance
 She bows her head and lifts her hands
 Her hips begin to circle slowly
 Her eyes have closed; her face is holy
 She holds the whole world in trance
 I love to watch a woman dance
 Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance

 She likes the slow songs of love lost
 They take her a million miles away
 'Cause to dream, sometimes, is the only way
 To go places you can't get to any other way
 Our eyes connect; she takes my hand
 I love to watch a woman dance
 Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance

 I feel my heart beating, and I wonder
 Will it ever satisfy my longing?
 I'm gonna hold on to you for as long as I can
 For who knows, this dance may be our only dance

 So we danced together, close and slow
 So slow we're almost standing still
 Her warm breath against my neck
 Slowly breaking down my will
 The room spins so I can barely stand
 The song ends; then, she lets go of my hand
 There's so much I don't understand
 But I love to watch a woman dance
 Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance
