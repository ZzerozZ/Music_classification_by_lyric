                        Risin' up, back on the street
 Did my time, took my chances
 Went the distance
 Now I'm back on my feet
 Just a man and his will to survive So many times, it happens too fast
 You trade your passion for glory
 Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
 You must fight just to keep them alive [Chorus]
 It's the eye of the tiger
 It's the thrill of the fight
 Risin' up to the challenge
 Of our rival
 And the last known survivor
 Stalks his prey in the night
 And he's watching us all with the
 Eye of the tiger Face to face, out in the heat
 Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
 They stack the odds
 Still we take to the street
 For the kill with the skill to survive [Chorus] Risin' up straight to the top
 Had the guts, got the glory
 Went the distance
 Now I'm not gonna stop
 Just a man and his will to survive [Chorus] The eye of the tiger
 The eye of the tiger
 The eye of the tiger
 The eye of the tiger
                        
                    |
