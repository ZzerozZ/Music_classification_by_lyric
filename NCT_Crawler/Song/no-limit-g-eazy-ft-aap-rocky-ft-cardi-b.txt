If I hit it one time I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I *** three times I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe

Tell your man pipe up
Nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance
Turn this *** into a nightclub
*** with me and get some money, yeah ayy
*** with me and get some money (ayy)
*** with me and get some money (ayy)
*** with G and get some money

No limit I'm a ***ing soldier, ayy
Always lit, yeah I'm never sober
It's been three days in a row, your bitch coming over
Told that bitch to kick rock, she act like it's a boulder, ayy
'Rari, shopping
Let me, cop it
Always, poppin'
Hella, poppin'
She's a bopper
Homie, hoppin'
Ain't no, stopping
Album, dropping

Got the city on fire
Bitch lying on me like she tired
I might have to *** around and call Kamaiyah
Hoe stirring up the pot, Jambalaya
Young Gerald
If I hit it one time I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I *** three times I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe

Tell your man pipe up
Nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance
Turn this *** into a nightclub
*** him then I get some money
*** him then I get some money
*** him then I get some money
*** him then I get some money

I need tongue
I need face
Give me brain, concentrate
I go foam, product case
Kill a weave, rock a lace
*** the Moe
Buy the ACE
*** the Ghost
Drive a Wraith
Get some money, flood the Rollie
*** the Rollie, patty face

My career takin' off
These hoes jogging in place
Swear these hoes run they mouth
How these hoes out of shape?
Can you stop with all the subs?
Bitch I ain’t Jared
If you really want some smoke
You can pull up, you can get it
Grab a hand full of braids, make a nigga eat me out
Put a white boy on Sazón

I might turn G-Eazy out
Keep it G from the club ‘til the end, from the spot
You know me, Cardi B
Pussy poppin’ on the charts
If I hit it one time I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I *** three times I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe

Tell your man pipe up
Nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance
Turn this *** into a nightclub
*** with me and get some money, yeah ayy
*** with me and get some money (ayy)
*** with me and get some money (ayy)
*** with G and get some money
Hit it one time I'ma pipe her

If I hit it two times then I like her
If I *** three times I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up
Nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance

Turn this *** into a nightclub
*** with me and get some money, yeah ayy
*** with me and get some money (ayy)
*** with me and get some money (ayy)
*** with G and get some money
