All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I want to loose them
Take my arms
I never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can i go on dear without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me
All of me
why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I want to loose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can i go on dear without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me
