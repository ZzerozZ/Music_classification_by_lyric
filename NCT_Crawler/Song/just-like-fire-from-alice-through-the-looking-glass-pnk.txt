                        Bài hát: Just Like Fire (From "Alice Through The Looking Glass") - P!nk

I know that I'm running out of time
(I want it all, mmm, mmm)
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I get it all the way
(I want it all, mmm, mmm)

We can get 'em running, running, running...
We can get 'em running running, running...

Just like fire, burning out the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna take?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, uh...

And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same
(mmm, mmm)
See I would rather we just go our different way than play the game
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together forever and ever
We don't have to worry about a thing about a thing

We can get 'em running, running, running
We can get 'em running, running, running

Just like fire, burning out the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna take?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, fire, fire
Running, running, running
We can get 'em running, running, running

So I can get it running
Just cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I've been here, I've done it
Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come on, come on with me
Oh, what you gonna do?
(What, what!?)
Oh, what you gonna do?
(What, what!?)
Oh, what you gonna do?
(What, what!?)
Oh, what you gonna do?

Just like fire, burning out the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire, burning out the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna take?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, fire!
Running, running, running
Just like fire!

(Running, running, running...)
