                        When I first saw you I knew nothing's like it used to be 
Boy you have got to be the finest thing in history 
The way I feel inside is just so hard to understand 
You'd be my appetite in ways I can't explain 

I'll eat you up 
(No, no, no, noo) 
I'll eat you up 
(No, no, no, noo) 
(Woah) 
I'll eat you up 
(Woah) 
So yum yum 
(Woah) 
Can't get enough 
(Woah oh oh) 
I think I'm in love 

If you move any closer boy there is no guarantee 
What I will do to you I fear it and it's scaring me 
Like I've become some kind of demon in the night 
You look so tasty and I could eat you up alive 

I'll eat you up 
(No, no, no, noo) 
I'll eat you up 
(No, no, no, noo) 
(Woah) 
I'll eat you up 
(Woah) 
So yum yum 
(Woah) 
Can't get enough 
(Woah oh oh) 
I think I'm in love
