                        Bài hát: Don't You Worry Child - Swedish House Mafia

There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall
I hear the sounds from the places where I was born

Up on the hill across the blue lake,
That's where I had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world,
Thought I'll never lose her out of sight,
We were so young
I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs, reminding me of a friend

Up on the hill across the blue lake,
That's where I had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

See heaven's got a plan for you
See heaven's got a plan for you
See heaven's got a plan for you

Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Ooh ooh ooh ooh!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh!
Yeah!
