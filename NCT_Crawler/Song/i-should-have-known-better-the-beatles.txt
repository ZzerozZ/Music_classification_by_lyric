                        I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do

Whoa, whoa, I
never realized what I kiss could be
this could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

So - o - o, I should have realized a lot of things before,
If this is love you've gotta give me more,
Give me more, hey, hey, hey, give me more.

Whoa whoa I never realized what I kiss could be
this could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too
you love me too
