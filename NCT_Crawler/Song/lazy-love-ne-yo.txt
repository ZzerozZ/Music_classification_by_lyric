                        Oooh my lobby call was 11:30
I'm officially the opposite of early
I gotta go downstairs
Everybody waiting down there for me
But I roll over into your curly hair
And sexy body, oh so nice and curvy
Reminiscing on last night
Wake up baby, let me get it one more time
Before, before, before
I gotta go, I got responsibilities
I gotta take care of, oh-woah, oh-woah
That's when you wrap them legs around me
And I fall victim to that lazy love

Oh, you got that, I don't wanna
That I don't wanna go nowhere, lazy love
You got that, I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing
You got that lazy love
Oh, you got that, I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing
You got that lazy love
Oh, you got that, I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing

Damn baby that was good, I'm gon' hit the shower
Even though I'm about two hours late
But I can't help it man
If they knew what I know, they would understand
I'm washing last night off, time to boss up
When suddenly on my back I feel a soft touch
She's right behind me
Water glisten off her body
Looking at me, like 'one more time'
But baby I gotta go, I got responsibilities
I gotta take care of, oh-woah, oh-woah
That's when you wrap them legs around me
And I fall victim to that lazy love

Oh, you got that, I don't wanna
That I don't wanna go nowhere, lazy love
You got that, I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing
You got that lazy love
Oh, you got that, I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing
You got that lazy love
Oh, you got that, I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing

Ooh I said ooh
Oooh that lazy love
Ooh yeah yeah
