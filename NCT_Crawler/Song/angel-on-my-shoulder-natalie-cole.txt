                        Written by Natalie Cole and Richard Marx


I never thought I'd ever make it, I can't believe the hell I've been through

Couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel, I didn't know what to do

I've been through the rain, I've been through the fire

There was something that I never knew

Chorus

I had an angel on my shoulder, with a plan for me divine

Must be an angel on my shoulder, who was right there all the time

(Angel, must be an angel) This world can be so cold and so heartless

Its hard to find your way alone, I used to run so fast, no one could catch me

I couldn't find the way back home, but I've laughed, I've cried

I almost died, but my broken heart just never knew

Chorus

I had an angel on my shoulder, with a plan for me divine

Got to be an angel on my shoulder, who was right there

Right there all the time, everybody needs someone to cling to

With an unchanging love, I finally found a hand to hold on to
                        
                    |
