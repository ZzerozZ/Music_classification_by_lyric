                        Hey you mrs. I don't know what the *** your name is
 I'm drawn to you, something's magnetic here
 If I could approach you
 Or even get close to the scent that you left behind
 I'd be fine No doubt that (no doubt)
 You bring out (bring out)
 The animal inside I'd eat you alive
 I'd eat you alive
 I'd eat you alive
 I'd eat you alive Hey you mrs. too good to look my way and that's cool
 You don't want nothing at all to do with me
 But I want you, ain't nothin' wrong with, wanting you
 'cause I'm a man and I can think what the hell I want
 You got that straight No doubt that (no doubt)
 I'd love to (I'd love)
 Sniff on them panties now I'd eat you alive
 I'd eat you alive
 I'd eat you alive
 I'd eat you alive I'm sorry, so sorry (damn you're so hot)
 You beauty is so vain (damn you're so hot)
 It drives me, yes it drives me (damn you're so hot)
 Absolutely insane I just want to look at you
 I just want to look at you
 I just want to look at you, all day
 There ain't nothing wrong, no
 There ain't nothing wrong with that Once you seep in (once you seep in)
 Under my skin (under my skin)
 There's nothing (nothing), there's nothing (nothing)
 In this world that could wash you away (wash you away, wash you away)
 Once you seep in (once you seep in) yeah
 Under my skin (under my skin)
 There's nothing (nothing) there's nothing(nothing)
 In this world that could wash you away (wash you away, wash you away) I'm sorry, so sorry (damn you're so hot)
 You beauty is so vain (damn you're so hot)
 It drives me, yes it drives me (damn you're so hot)
 Absolutely insane I'd eat you alive
 I'd eat you alive
 I'd eat you alive
 I'd eat you alive
 I'd eat you alive
