                        Bài hát: Hush (Goblin OST) - Lasse Lindh 

Through the endless daydream 
I saw you on the way back 
There I walked with you in my arms 
Through the blurry darkness 
Who’s veiling on the twilight 
We’ve been far away from my fears 
Somewhere else I’ll see you 
Our days be like a blossom 
Blooming all around you 
so bright 
By and by 
I’ll miss you 
and your laugh like a sunshine 
Fading into shadow of tears 
All around me is your light 
With you 
everything so shines 
How come we’ll leave all behind 
Cause your love is falling 
on my heart 
And I’m falling for you 
Falling with broken wings again 
Hush now my angel 
I will always be with you 
In your pretty smile 
in a glow of tears 
Out across the frosty night 
I’ll be there with you 
Maybe someday 
you’ll wake up alone without me 
But don’t cry again 
I’ll be waiting here 
Where the moon is on the rise 
As the olden days 
I could just go with you 
between our time 
Where they can’t find us 
somehow 
You could just come away 
with me out there 
Where we could dream away 
All day 
Hush now my angel 
I will always be with you 
In your pretty smile 
in a glow of tears 
Out across the frosty night 
I’ll be there with you 
Maybe you’ll always breath in me 
ever in my heart 
All the little pieces of you 
look how they shine above 
Come away with me tonight 
We’ll be dreaming away there 
Maybe you’ll always breath in me 
ever in my heart 
All the little pieces of you 
look how they shine above 
Come away with me tonight 
We’ll be dreaming away there 
Always
                        
                    |
