                        (Hang on) got to go
 Preview what they oughtta know
 Keep your head down and *** die
 (Wake up) rise and shine
 Gotta take another pint
 Dig heads and watch out for the night
 When the sun comes down and the moon comes up in the sky
 The battle of the day and the night
 (Kill, kill, kill) go *** another one
 Candlelight burns in a wood so high
 On a carpet (flying high) take it down to the other side
 The way beyond it may lie
 When the moon comes up and is rescuing under the night
 The reaper is on the other side, let's go
 Bodom after midnight
 Bodom after midnight yeah
