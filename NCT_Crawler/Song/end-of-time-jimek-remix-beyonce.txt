                        Bài hát: End Of Time (JIMEK Remix) - Beyonce

Come take my hand
 I won't let you go
 I'll be your friend
 I will love you so deeply
 I will be the one to kiss you at night
 I will love you until the end of time
 I'll be your baby
 Now promise not to let you go
 Love you like crazy
 Now say you'll never let me go
 Say you'll never let me go (say)
 Say you'll never let me go
 Say you'll never let me go (say)
 Say you'll never let me go

 [Verse 1]
 Take you away from here
 It's nothing between us but space and time
 I'll be your own little star that'll be shining you up
 Or your own little universe, make me your girl

 [Hook]
 Come take my hand
 I won't let you go
 I'll be your friend
 I will love you so, deeply
 I will be the one to kiss you at night
 I will love you until the end of time
 I'll be your baby
 Now promise not to let you go
 Love you like crazy
 Now say you'll never let me go
 Say you'll never let me go (say)
 Say you'll never let me go
 Say you'll never let me go (say)
 Say you'll never let me go
