Blues/Jazz|

                        You go to my head
 And you linger like a haunting refrain
 And I find you spinning round in my brain
 Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne You go to my head
 Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
 And I find the very mention of you
 Like the kicker in a julep or two The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought
 To my plea, casts a spell over me
 Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
 Can't you see that it never can be You go to my head
 With a smile that makes my temperature rise
 Like a summer with a thousand July's
 You intoxicate my soul with your eyes Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
 Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
 You go to my head
 You go to my head Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
 Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
 You go to my head
 You go to my head
