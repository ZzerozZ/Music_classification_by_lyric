Hey Hey Oh... 
Hey Hey Oh... 

It's you and me moving 
At the speed of light into eternity yer, 
Tonight is the night to join me in the middle of ecstasy. 
Feel the melody in the rhythm of the music around you, around you 
I'm gonna take you there, I'm gonna take you there 
So don't be scared 
I'm right here baby 
We can go anywhere, go anywhere 
But first it's your chance, 
Take my hand come with me 

[Chorus:] 
It's like I've waited my whole life for this one night 
It's gonna be me you and the dance floor 
'cause we've only got one night 
Double your pleasure 
Double your fun and dance 
Forever (ever, ever) 
Forever (ever, ever) 
Forever (ever, ever) 
Forever girl forever 
Forever (ever, ever) 
Forever (ever, ever) 
Forever (ever, ever) 
Forever on the dance floor 

Feels like we're on another level 
Feels like our loves intertwined, 
We can be two rebels breaking the rules 
me and you, you and I 
All you got to do is watch me 
Look what I can do with my feet 
Baby feel the beat inside, 
I'm driving you can take the front seat 
Just need you to trust me 
Oh ah oh 
It's like! 

[Chorus] 

It's a long way down, 
We're so high off the ground, 
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart 
Girl, where did you come from? 
Got me so undone, 
Gazing in your eyes got me singing what a beautiful lady 
No "if"s, "and"s or "maybe"s 
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing 
There's no one else that matters 
you love me and I won't let you fall girl 
Let you fall girl oh 
Ah ah ye yer 
I won't let you fall, let you fall 
Let you fall oh oh 
Yer yer 
Yer yer 
It's Like! 

[Chorus] 

Oh ah ah ah ah ah 
Yer 
Forever (ever, ever, ever) 
Forever ever ah.
                        
                    |
