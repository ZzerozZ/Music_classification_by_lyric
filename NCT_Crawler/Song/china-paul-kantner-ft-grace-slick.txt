                        She'll suck on anything you give her
 Stare at anything that's shiny bright
 Her voice cuts through the sea even when its stormy
 But she's only two feet high - she'll get higher I hope she sees some things that will make her time happy
 It all comes in so fast it all comes in She sleeps through almost any sound
 Even when its screaming loud and clear
 But she wakes up and smiles at a friendly voice
 If it whispers softly in her ear I see in her new face, a clear beginning
 It all comes in so fast it all comes in
 She knows who she is without looking
 She says it out happy when the feeling is there
 She's an all new person who says just what she feels
 She's a fat faced goddess of nowhere I hope she sees some things that will make her time happy
 It all comes in so fast it all comes in
                        
                    |
