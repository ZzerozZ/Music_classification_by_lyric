                        Everyone agreed that she looked delightful
 Except for her sister, who was hateful and spiteful
 Blushing bright red from her head to her feet
 But rushing into the bridal suite The imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir
 This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir Life turns out like a TV serial
 A head full of daydreams, his hands full of material
 She says it's nothing, he's messing up her hair
 And still he looks so neat, stepping into the bridal suite The imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir
 This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir So the best man will do his best again
 Now they're getting dressed again
 Blushing bright red from her head to her feet
 Sneaking out of the bridal suite The imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir
 This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir
 We know who you're with and where you are In the imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir
 This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir
 Two names under register In the imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir
 This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir
 Au revoir, au revoir, au revoir
