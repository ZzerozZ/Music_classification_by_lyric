                        Since I was born they couldn't hold me down 
Another misfit kid, another burned-out town 

Never played by the rules I never really cared 
My nasty reputation takes me everywhere 

I look and see it's not only me 
So many others have stood where I stand 
We are the young so raise your hands 

They call us problem child 
We spend our lives on trial 
We walk an endless mile 
We are the youth gone wild 
We stand and we won't fall 
We're the one and one for all 
The writing's on the wall 
We are the youth gone wild 

Boss screamin' in my ear about who I'm supposed to be 
Getcha a 3-piece Wall Street smile and son you'll look just like me 

I said "Hey man, there's something that you oughta know. 
I tell ya Park Avenue leads to Skid Row." 

I look and see it's not only me 
We're standin' tall ain't never a doubt 
We are the young, so shout it out 

They call us problem child 
We spend our lives on trial 
We walk an endless mile 
We are the youth gone wild 
We stand and we won't fall 
We're the one and one for all 
The writing's on the wall 
We are the youth gone wild 

They call us problem child 
We spend our lives on trial 
We walk an endless mile 
We are the youth gone wild 
We stand and we won't fall 
We're the one and one for all 
The writing's on the wall 
We are the youth gone wild 
We are the youth gone wild
                        
                    |
