                        I take it all back
 All that I said
 It comes out to fast

 So I

 Just couldn't help
 The way that I felt
 I started the fire.

 Watching you walk
 I followed you there
 Standing too close

 It's hurting.

 I pictured the words
 The warmth of your breath.
 I started the fire

 It's burning.

 And it feels like jealousy
 And it feels like I can't breathe
 And I'm on, down on my knees
 And it feels like jealousy.

 Seeing a light
 A face in the crowd
 My lonely heart is racing.

 And my whole world
 Is under attack.
 What kinda love am I facing?

 Is it me that you want
 Cos it's me you can have
 Can you give me an answer?

 I'm tired of waiting.
 I'm tired of thinking.

 And it feels like jealousy
 And it feels like I can't breathe
 And I'm on, down on my knees
 And it feels like jealousy.

 I'm tired of waiting.

 I'm tired of thinking.

 And it feels like jealousy (hey)
 And it feels like I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
 And I'm on, down on my knees (ohh)
 And it feels like jealousy
                        
                    |
