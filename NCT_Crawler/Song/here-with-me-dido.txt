                        I didn't hear you leave 
I wonder how am I still here
And I don't want to move a thing 
It might change my memory

Oh I am what I am 
I'll do what I want 
But I can't hide
And I won't go
I won't sleep
I can't breathe 
Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me

I don't want to call my friends 
They might wake me from this dream
And I can't leave this bed,
Risk forgetting all that's been

Oh I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide
And I won't go
I won't sleep
And I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me

And I won't go
And I won't sleep
And I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me

Oh I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide
And I won't go
I won't sleep
And I can't breathe 
Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here

And I won't go
And I won't sleep
And I can't breathe 
Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me
                        
                    |
