Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Walking through the traffic on a Monday
 In the town I grew up
 Shelter from the rain in every doorway
 It's dark and everyone's numb
 Kids are making faces in the bus lane
 But nobody looks up
 Everyone's life the same as yesterday
 Just like the ticking of clocks And I'm craving, craving, craving something I can feel
 Where do I go what do I need?
 Is it ecstasy or is it fear?
 Am I on my own am I even close?
 'Cause I'm craving, still craving something I can feel Never thought the night could get so lonely
 'Til she called me up
 Never thought these streets could've outgrown me
 I guess it wasn't enough
 So I put my faith in everyone around me
 Then she sold all my stuff
 Sheer and wild abandon, that's all I need
 And someone I can trust 'Cause I'm craving, craving, craving something I can feel
 Where do I go what do I need?
 Is it ecstasy or is it fear?
 Am I on my own am I even close?
 'Cause I'm craving, still craving something I can feel Take me far from streets and roads
 Lead me out in the night
 Don't show me the way back home
 'Cause I Yes I'm craving, craving, craving something I can feel
 Where do I go what do I need?
 Is it ecstasy or is it fear?
 Am I on my own am I even close?
 'Cause I'm craving, still craving something I can feel Craving something I can feel
 Oh, craving something I can feel
 Craving, I'm craving something I can feel
                        
                    |
