There's a fire that burns inside
It's an instinct that never lies
The target's tattooed between our eyes

Stand and fight
Under the lights on the high stage
A part of your life it can take away
Just like the blood running through your veins

Everyone's watching through your eyes
There's only two options
Win or die, win or die
Win or die, die, die, die, die
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So reply, so reply

And ignite
Ignite
Ignite
Ignite

There's a power that's underneath
And you can't see it 'til you believe
On the edge of infinity

Feel the rush
Under the lights on the high stage
A part of your life it can take away
Just like the blood running through your veins

Everyone's watching through your eyes
There's only two options
Win or die, win or die
Win or die, die, die, die, die
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So reply, so reply

And ignite
Ignite
Ignite
Ignite

It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So ignite, so ignit
