                        Bài hát: Chain Hang Low - Jibbs

Do your chain hang low 
Do it wobble to the flo' 
Do it shine in the light 
Is it platinum, Is it gold 
Could you throw it over ya shoulda 
If ya hot, it make ya cold 
Do your chain hang low 

[Jibbs] 
[Hook] 
Is that your chain!? 
Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang 
Hop out the ride n let the diamonds smoke off the range 
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang 
You know the name! 

Is that your chain!? 
Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang 
Hop out the ride n let the diamonds smoke off the range 
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang 
I'm off the chain! 

[Verse 1] 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'm hot kid 
Chains so low you would think that diamonds never stop it 
And it's funny cause you could never stop it 
A bunch of rocks on my hand n I ain't even on the block yet 
Show em white gold sorta hold em like my tims 
And a chain hang 24 inches like the rims 
Diamonds all blown up yeah sorta like a pimp 
So when I like hit the ice 
It starts glistening off the tims (off the tims) 

My chain hang 
All it do is blang blang 
Half blue, half red 
Like my diamonds gang bang 
And don't even think 
We on the same thing 
Charms so heavy they couldn't lift it till the crane came 

[Chorus] 
Do your chain hang low 
Do it wobble to the flo' 
Do it shine in the light 
Is it platinum, Is it gold 
Could you throw it over ya shoulda 
If ya hot, it make ya cold 
Do your chain hang low 

Do your chain hang low 
Do it wobble to the flo' 
Do it shine in the light 
Is it platinum, is it gold? 
Could you throw it over ya shoulda? 
If ya hot, it make ya cold 
Do your chain hang low 

[Verse 2] 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'm so icy (do yo chain) 
My trunk so heavy that my neck don't like me (do yo chain) 
[ From: http://www.***/read/j/jibbs-lyrics/chain-hang-low-lyrics.html ] 
Go n no no no is not a game kid (do yo chain) 
Cause I throw my chain in the crowd (do do do do do do yo chain) 
Like game B 

Is nothing 
Diamonds is nothing to me 
(do yo chain) Especially when I'm dressing up 
It's just a button to me 
Bling! (could you throw it over yo shoulda) and not to mention my teeth 
Cause they color coordinated 
Complimenting the teeth 
Oh bra (boy) dats! 

So check out my swag 
Diamonds red, white, n blue like the American flag 
Boy (do yo chain) is so colorful 
N see I got that nice screen 
My money spend on jewels 
I call it my ice cream (chain, chain, chain, chain) 

My music give you black eye 
Cuz of the beating 
They think I am a mutant 
The way a boy is beasting (chain, chain, chain, chain) 
I stay when n sometime you call it cheating 
Yeah, my boys always around 
Like it's a mee-ting 

Is that your (do yo chain) chain!? 
Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang (do yo chain) 
Hop out the ride n let the diamonds smoke off the range (do yo chain) 
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang (do yo chain) 
You know the name! (do do do do do do yo chain) 

Is that your chain!? 
Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang (do yo chain) 
Hop out the ride n let the diamonds smoke off the range (do yo chain) 
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang (do yo chain) 
I'm off the chain! (do do do do do do yo chain) 

Do your chain hang low 
Do it wobble to the flo' 
Do it shine in the light 
Is it platinum, Is it gold 
Could you throw it over ya shoulda 
If ya hot, it make ya cold 
Do your chain hang low 

Do your chain hang low 
Do it wobble to the flo' 
Do it shine in the light 
Is it platinum, Is it gold 
Could you
