                        Bài hát: Maybe - Yiruma

Maybe it ́s the way you used to love me
Maybe it ́s the way I feel you now
I ́m feeling like the sky is falling on me
And my life is tumbling down

Maybe I ́m lost in the moment
I don ́t wanna be found
Feel like I must save the moment

Maybe I ́m a fool for loving you
Maybe you ́re right and maybe I ́m wrong
Maybe cause I don ́t know what to do
Won ́t somebody please help me
Maybe I got something else to say
It really doesn ́t matter anyway
It ́s just a little word an empty call
No maybe means nothing and all

Maybe one day I win the lottery
Maybe I ́ll be poor all my life
And there so many possibilities
All I got to do is try try try

But I ́m still lost in this feeling
Now I wanna be found

Can anyone stop me from falling

Maybe I ́m a fool for loving you
Maybe you ́re right and maybe I ́m wrong
Maybe cause I don ́t know what to do
Won ́t somebody please help me
Maybe I got something else to say
It really doesn ́t matter anyway
It ́s just a little word an empty call
No maybe means nothing and all

I won ́t be waiting I can ́t be wasting no more time
Cause I got day the line sometime
No second guessing it ́s only messing with my life
I don ́t want it anymore no

Maybe I ́m a fool for loving you
Maybe you ́re right and maybe I ́m wrong
Maybe cause I don ́t know what to do
Won ́t somebody please help me
Maybe I got something else to say
It really doesn ́t matter anyway
It ́s just a little word an empty call
No maybe means nothing and all...
