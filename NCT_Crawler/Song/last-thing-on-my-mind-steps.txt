                        There was something in your voice,
That was telling me don't be too sure,
Arousing my suspicions,
I have never felt before,
I thought we had it made,
I thought you'd never go away.

But now you're suddenly like a stranger,
And you're leaving our love behind,
Of all the things I was ever planning for,
This was the last thing on my mind.

When I looked into your eyes,
There was something you weren't telling me,
But in my confusion I just couldn't see,
If there was any doubt,
I thought that we would work it out.

But now you're suddenly like a stranger,
And you're leaving our love behind,
Of all the things I was ever planning for,
This was the last thing on my mind.
