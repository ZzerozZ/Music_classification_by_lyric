                        Bài hát : The Walker - Fitz And The Tantrums

Ooh, crazy's what they think about me
Ain't gonna stop cause they tell me so
Cause 99 miles per hour baby,
Is how fast that I like to go.

Can't keep up with my rhythm
Though they keep trying.
Too quick for the lines they throw.
I walk to the sound of my own drum,
It goes, they go, we go, hey yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus:]
Oh, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really need it, need it, so go
Gotta feel it, body takes control
Really need it, need it

I wake up to the city of angels
To see my name headlining the coast
They say I'm a walking dreamer, baby
If I stop they would make the show

Can't keep up with my rhythm
Though they keep trying.
Too quick for the lines they throw.
I walk to the sound of my own drum,
It goes, they go, we go, hey yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus x2]

Everybody walk
Everybody walk
Everybody walk, walk, walk...

[Chorus x2]
                        
                    |
