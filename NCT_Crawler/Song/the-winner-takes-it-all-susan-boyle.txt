                        Bài hát: The Winner Takes It All - Susan Boyle

I don't wanna talk
about the things we've gone through
though it's hurting me
now it's history
I've played all my cards
and that's what you've done too
nothing more to say
no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
the loser standing small
beside the victory
that's her destiny

I was in your arms
thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
building me a fence
building me a home
thinking I'd be strong there
but I was a fool
playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
their minds as cold as ice
and someone way down here
loses someone dear
the winner takes it all
the loser has to fall
it's simple and it's plain
why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss
like I used to kiss you
does it feel the same
when she calls your name
somewhere deep inside
you must know I miss you
but what can I say
rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
the likes of me abide
spectators of the show
always staying low
the game is on again
a lover or a friend
a big thing or a small
the winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
if it makes you feel sad
and I understand
you've come to shake my hand
I apologize
if it makes you feel bad
seeing me so tense
no self-confidence

B ut you see
the winner takes it all
                        
                    |
