                        Bài hát: All This Time - Tiffany

All this time
I know someday you would need to find
something that you left behind
something I can not give you
All these tears
and like a night love disappears
but hearts are good for souvenirs
and memories are forever
All This time
all in all I have no regrets
the sun still shines the sun still sets
and the heart forgives, the heart forgets
though what will I do now with all this time?
One more kiss
even though it has come to this
I will close my eyes and make a wish, hoping you will remember
All This time
all in all I have no regrets
the sun still shines the sun still sets
and the heart forgives, the heart forgets
though what will I do now with all this time?
Say Goodbye, apart we will make another try
but do not be sorry if you cry
I will be crying too
All this day
All This time
all in all I have no regrets
the sun still shines the sun still sets
and the heart forgives, the heart forgets
though what will I do now with all this time?
What will I do now, with all this time
                        
                    |
