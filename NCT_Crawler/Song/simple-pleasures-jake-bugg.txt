                        You've been huntin' round for treasure
 Find it all in the simple pleasures
 I don't understand this life you lead
 Tryna be somebody else and
 Tryna be the one's who help
 Wanna find the one who helps you breathe Maybe it's all a big mistake
 And you live on all you take
 From the lives that have always been close
 I've been roaming around for hours
 Singing all your songs of praise How on earth can I complain
 How in hell can I be safe
 From this sudden fear of change
 This sudden fear is strange Tryna understand your ways
 You hide them with convulsive rage
 You tried to be the best you could be
 People finding the most pleasure
 All within the smallest treasures
 This don't seem possible to me And maybe it's all that you've done wrong
 So just bite your silver tongue
 That you lied with, lied to yourself I've been roaming around for hours
 Singing all your songs of praise
 How on earth can I complain
 How in hell can I be safe
 From this sudden fear of change
 This sudden fear is strange You've been huntin' round for treasure
 Find it all in the simple pleasures
 I don't understand this life you lead
 Maybe it's all a big mistake
 And you live on all you take
 From the lives that have always been close I've been roaming around for hours
 Singing all your songs while
 Standing at the edge about to fall
 Faces crushed against the wall
 The sudden fear of singing all your songs of
 Staring into space I hear the sound
 From a voice that's never found
 The sudden fear is strange But maybe it's all a big mistake
 And you live on all you take
 From the lives that have always been close
 I've been roaming around for hours
 Singing all your songs of praise
 How on earth can I complain
 How in hell can I be safe
 This sudden fear is strange
 This sudden fear of change
