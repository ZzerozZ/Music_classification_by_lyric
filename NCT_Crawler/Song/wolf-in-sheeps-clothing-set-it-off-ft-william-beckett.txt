                        Bài hát: Wolf In Sheep's Clothing - Set It Off, William Beckett

Ha-Ha-Ha! It's about you 
Beware, beware, be skeptical 
Of their smiles, their smiles of plated gold 
Deceit so natural 
But a wolf in sheep's clothing is more than a warning 
Bah-bah-black sheep, have you any soul? 
No sir, by the way, what the hell are morals? 

Jack, be nimble, Jack, be quick 
Jill's a little *** and her alibis are dirty tricks 

So could you 
Tell me how you're sleeping easy 
How you're only thinking of yourself 
Show me how you justify 
Telling all your lies like second nature 
Listen, mark my words: one day (one day) 
You will pay, you will pay 
Karma's gonna come collect your death 

Aware, aware, you stalk your prey 
With criminal mentality 
You sink your teeth into the people you depend on 
Infecting everyone, you're quite the problem 
Fee-fi-fo-fum, you better run and hide 
I smell the blood of a petty little coward 

Jack, be lethal, Jack, be slick 
Jill will leave you lonely dying in a filthy ditch 

So could you 
Tell me how you're sleeping easy 
How you're only thinking of yourself 
Show me how you justify 
Telling all your lies like second nature 
Listen, mark my words: one day (one day) 
You will pay, you will pay 
Karma's gonna come collect your death 

Maybe you'll change 
Abandon all your wicked ways 
Make amends and start anew again 
Maybe you'll see 
All the wrongs you did to me 
And start all over, start all over again 

Who am I kidding? 
Now, let's not get overzealous here 
You've always been a huge piece of *** 
If I could kill you I would 
But it's frowned upon in all fifty states 
Having said that, burn in hell 

(Where are you, motherfucker? Ha ha!) 

So tell me how you're sleeping easy 
How you're only thinking of yourself 
Show me how you justify 
Telling all your lies like second nature 
Listen, mark my words: one day (one day) 
You will pay, you will pay 
Karma's gonna come collect your death 

Karma's gonna come collect your death 
Karma's gonna come collect your death
                        
                    |
