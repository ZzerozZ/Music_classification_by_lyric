                        Bài Hát: Alone - Alan Walker

Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I loosing my mind
Never let me go

If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

Anywhere whenever
Apart but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away

If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

Anywhere whenever
Apart but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone
