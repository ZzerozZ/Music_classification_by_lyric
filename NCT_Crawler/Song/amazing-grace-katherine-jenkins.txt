                        Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
 That saved a wretch like me.
 I once was lost but now am found,
 Was blind, but now I see. T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
 And Grace, my fears relieved.
 How precious did that Grace appear
 The hour I first believed. Through many dangers, toils and snares
 We have already come;
 'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
 and Grace will lead us home. The Lord has promised good to me.
 His word my hope secures.
 He will my shield and portion be,
 As long as life endures. Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
 And mortal life shall cease,
 I shall possess within the veil,
 A life of joy and peace. When we've been here ten thousand years
 Bright shining as the sun.
 We've no less days to sing God's praise
 Than when we've first begun.
