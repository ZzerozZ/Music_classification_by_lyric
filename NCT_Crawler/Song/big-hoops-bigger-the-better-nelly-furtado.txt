 I'll be there till dawn
 I'm going down, I've got my big hoops on
 Pant leg so wide, I've got my backpack on
 I'm gonna hear my favorite song Hey hey hey, what's the scenario
 That boy keeps passin' my by
 I said no diggity, no doubt
 I thought I told you I was fly
 Yeah he and all of his friends they
 They got that hair like high five I don't wanna talk about sex
 Wanna express myself tonight I can go fast, I can go slow
 I can go places nobody else goes
 I can move fast, I can move slow
 I can go places nobody else goes Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day
 Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day I betcha never seen something like that like that like that like that
 I betcha never heard something like that like that like that like that
 I betcha never seen something like that That boy gonna feel my poison
 I know he can't stand the rain
 I wanna be down with ya baby
 Back and forth, back and forth
 Back, back, back and forth
 You got my rump rump shaking
 I'm another bad creation, I'm real
 And I never have to fake it fake it
 Ya know I gotta move quick
 And I gotta move slow
 Cause there no end in the road I can go fast, I can go slow
 I can go places nobody else goes
 I can move fast, I can move slow
 I can go places nobody else goes Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day
 Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day I betcha never seen something like that like that like that like that
 I betcha never heard something like that like that like that like that
 I betcha never seen something like that like that like that like that
 I betcha never heard something like that like that like that like that
