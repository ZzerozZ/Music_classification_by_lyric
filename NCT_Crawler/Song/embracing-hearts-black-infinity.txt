                        Black Infinity - Embracing Hearts ( And How We Died Alone )

Like the sound from the silence 
Covering our Hearts 
We 've drowned to this place 
Deeper .... More and More. 

In the loneliness of life 
We've prayed to the Gods 
for the healing song on your Pain 

Chorus : 

Frozen sky we've stayed and Sleep inside 
And how we died alone ? 
My evenfall downs with the Crimson wine 
Our tears have cried nomore 
in The End...We are all alone.... 
Embracing my heart ...with you... 
A teardrop from your eyes... 
is the fear drowning in my nights.
                        
                    |
