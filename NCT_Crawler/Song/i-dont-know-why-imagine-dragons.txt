                        Bài hát: I Don't Know Why - Imagine Dragons

We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passing in the shadows
Loving the risk of being found
When we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're living in a lie of trust

I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you

I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And were caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost it hurts
We're living in a lie of trust

I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you

(Tell me that you love me)
(Tell me that you love me)
(Tell me that you love me)
(Tell me that you love me)
Dangerous
(Tell me that you love me)
(Tell me that you love me)
Your love is always dangerous
(Tell me that you love me)
(Tell me that you love me)

I don't know why
I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
