                        It comes calling in the evening
 When the temperature is dropping out
 They said it don't get cold here
 But I beg to differ now There is something in the shadows
 More than sister silhouette
 Something sinister and strange
 That I haven't seen yet And I don't wanna be alone
 Sky, don't let the sun go
 I'm not ready for the darkness
 Swear upon a heartless soul And I don't wanna cry when you go
 Stay a little longer, you know
 You're making me feel
 I'm not alone You don't have to fight the bad guys
 Throwing punches out into the black
 If you have to tell me lies, I don't care
 Just give me some good back And I don't wanna be alone
 Sky, don't let the sun go
 I'm not ready for the darkness
 Swear upon a heartless soul And I don't wanna cry when you go
 Stay a little longer, you know
 You're making me feel
 I'm not alone And if I only worry 'bout it, worry 'bout it, worry 'bout it
 I just keep breaking down, breaking down, breaking down
 Oh, I could do without, do without, do without
 A night of the bad dreams, sad things
 Tell me what that means I don't wanna be alone
 Sky, don't let the sun go
 I'm not ready for the darkness
 Swear upon a heartless soul And I don't wanna cry when you go
 Stay a little longer, you know
 You're making me feel
 The monsters aren't real
 You're making me feel
 I'm not alone I'm not alone, no
 I'm not alone, no
 (I'm not alone)
