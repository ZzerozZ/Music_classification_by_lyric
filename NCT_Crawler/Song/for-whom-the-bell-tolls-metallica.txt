                        Make his fight
On the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside

Shouting gun
On they run
Through the endless grey

On they fight
Are they right
Yes, but who's to say?

For a hill men would kill
Why?
They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride

Men of five
Still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane
From the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look
To the sky
Just before you die
It's the last time he will

Blackened roar
Massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal
Fills his soul with a ruthless cry

Stranger now
Are his eyes to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud

Crack of dawn
All is gone
Except the will to be

Now they see what will be
Blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls...
                        
                    |
