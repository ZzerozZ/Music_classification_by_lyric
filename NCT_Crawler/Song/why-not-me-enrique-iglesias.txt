                        Bài hát: Why Not Me? - Enrique Iglesias

Escaping nights without you with shadows on the wall
My mind is running wild trying hard not to fall
You tell me that you love me but say I'm just a friend
My heart is broken up into pieces
'Cause I know I'll never free my soul
It's trapped in between true love and being alone
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor

[Pre-chorus:]
Why oh why tell me why not me
Why oh why we were meant to be
Baby I know I could be all you need
Why oh why oh why

[Chorus:]
I wanna love you
If you only knew how much I love you
So why not me

The day after tomorrow I'll still be around
To catch you when you fall and never let you down
You say that we're forever our love will never end
I've tried to come up but it's drowning me to know
You'll never feel my soul
It's trapped in between true love and being alone
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor

Tell me baby...

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

You won't ever know
How far we can go (go)
You won't ever know
How far we can go (go)

[Pre-chorus 2x]

[Chorus]

(why not me, why not me, why not me)
                        
                    |
