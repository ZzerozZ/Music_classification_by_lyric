                        Mmm, mmm
 It's been seven long hours
 Since you left me babe
 Sitting here
 Thinking 'bout how
 How you let it slip away
 I can't get no sleep
 (No sleep)
 Don't even wanna
 Go nowhere
 It's on my mind
 What you did wrong
 And now you
 Wanna come back

 When a man does wrong
 Ain't no coming back home
 He's been out there too long
 She won't even
 Talk on the phone
 (Settle this, settle this)
 When a man does wrong
 Ain't no coming back home
 Can't come around
 There ain't no place
 She don't wanna
 See your face

 Said you never
 Wanted to hurt me
 Never even wanted to leave
 Said that you
 Never did deserve me
 Now you begging me
 Please, please, please believe
 Now you feeling like a fool
 (Fool)
 Never thought about me
 Just you

 It's on your mind
 What you did wrong
 And now you
 Wanna come back

 When a man does wrong
 Ain't no coming back home
 He's been out there too long
 She won't even
 Talk on the phone
 When a man does wrong
 Ain't no coming back home
 (No, no, no, no)
 Can't come around
 There ain't no place
 She don't wanna
 See your face

 Why'd you have
 To do it baby?
 Do it do it to me
 Why'd you have
 To use and abuse me?
 See I've been sitting
 Waiting at night
 Just wasting my time
 (Wasting my time)
 Now, now I know
 Now I know
 Gotta go gotta go
 (Yeah go, yeah go, yeah)

 When a man does wrong
 Ain't no coming back home
 Can't come around
 There ain't no place
 She don't wanna
 See your face
