                        Bài hát: Oxygen - Spice Girls

There will come a time
I know I'm gonna need
Someone I can trust, someone who'll fight for me
That's the way I love

This is my time to work things out
What I want from this life
There will be someone out there for me
That's the way I love

It doesn't really matter who ever you are
Don't matter where you go
Just make sure you're there to answer when love comes around
Don't be surprised when love knocks at your door

You're the breath that I take
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breath in
Brings me warmth from within
When you touch me I start believing
Loving is like oxygen

Even when we're so far apart
I still feel you in my heart
Cos you've given me the greatest gift of all
That's the way I love

The way I love may be easy, but could it ever be for me?
This situation seems so insane
It's all about feeling without insecurities
That's the way I love

It doesn't really matter who ever you are
Don't matter where you go
Just make sure you're there to answer when love comes around
Don't be surprised when love knocks at your door

You're the breath that I take
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breath in
Brings me warmth from within
When you touch me I start believing
Loving is like oxygen
(You're in every breath I take)

Imagine a life without love
I'd be so afraid (so afraid)
Cos the love that we share
Would be hard to replace
Baby hold me and never leave me
This love is my oxygen
(This love is my oxygen)

Open your heart
Take a deep breath
Stop searching and start believing
Make sure you're there to answer when love comes around
Don't be surprised when true love knocks at your door

You're the breath that I take
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breathe in
Brings me warmth from within
When you touch me (I start believing)
Loving is like oxygen
(You're in every breath I take)

Imagine a life without love
I'd be so afraid
Cos the love that we share
Would be hard to replace
Baby hold me and never leave me
This love is my oxygen
(This love is my oxygen)
