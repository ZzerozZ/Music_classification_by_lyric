                        Bài hát: No Promise (Live) - Shayne Ward

Hey baby, when we are together doing things that we love.
Every time you're near I feel like I’m in heaven feeling high
I don’t want to let go, girl.
I just need you to know, girl.

I don’t wanna run away, baby, you’re the one I need tonight.
No promises.
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your arms here tonight

Hey baby, when we are together doing things that we love.

I just need you to know, girl.

I don’t wanna run away, baby, you’re the one I need tonight.
No promises.
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your arms.

I don’t want to run away, I want to stay forever, through time and time.
No promises

I don’t wanna run away, I don’t wanna be alone.
No promises.
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, now and forever, my love.
No promises

I don’t wanna run away, baby, you’re the one I need tonight,
No promises.
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your arms here tonight.

I don’t wanna run away, baby, you’re the one I need tonight.
No promises.
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your arms here tonight.
