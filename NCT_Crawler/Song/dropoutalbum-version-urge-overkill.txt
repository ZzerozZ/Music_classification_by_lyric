                        What's the matter with you?
 You've been down all day
 What happened to you
 To make you feel that way?
 Baby aint that a shame when they call you those names
 Dropping out from school
 Guess it wasn't so cool
 Everyone, everyone needs, some space to breathe
 All the time we have been blind, so blind
 Yeah we just couldn't see it,
 Yeah you're too old to cry
 Too young to die
 What happens in the in between?
 Don't you think it's strange, things just change
 Its just a burnt out town a burnt out scene
 You've been a dropout ever since you've been seventeen
 Lonley child when will you see?
 You need to be free
 Often times people they find
 They're not blind
 Yeah, they just don't see
 Lonely child listen to me
 Its just a burnt out town
 Its just a one horse scene
 Gotta get away, gotta get away, you got to
 Hanging out in the parking lot at Dairy Queen
 You've been a dropout ever since you've been seventeen
 Gotta get away, gotta get away, you got to..
