                        Say the judge or the jury can't spoil this
 Nah two thirds of the world's most loyalest
 I'mma shoot em
 I'mma pay the bail, I'm sure of this
 I'mma kill em I'mma get the witness, teach 'em more of this
 We never sing not even on a song where the chorus is
 Dig the hole, get the wood box bring the florist in
 Tell the pastor tell the family we was just warning them
 38's 45's, all type of Taurus'
 About to hit the bong, pour the holy water in
 Celebrating for participating and the slaughtering
 Eating steaks at the same spot they killed Paulie in
 Frank White's three in the quarter taping your daughter in
 Columbia with the connect putting the order in
 Nigga act we gonna clap like we the audience
 Make sure you wipe down the strap, get rid of all the prints
 Do your homework on whoever you go to war against I had 20's on my Benz, lent it to all my friends
 And everything was all gravy, everything was all gravy
 And if I need something call Baby, I need something call Baby
 And the streets was calling me, but a nigga had call waiting
 And yeah we all went through our phases
 We all went through our savings
 Some niggas stayed on point, some niggas was point shaving
 And sometimes we had to be vegetables
 That mean we had to stay patient cause they say you are what you eat
 I took the star out of starvation, bitch
 I come from a Third World, start rapping in the fourth grade
 Start trapping in the sixth grade, went platinum in the tenth grade
 Dropped out a nigga was getting paid
 This when Birdman had a fade
 This when Hummers didn't come stretch, but Birdman had 'em made,
 This when pretty bitches set you up, and niggas didn't give two ***s
 You had two guns and two phones, you could waste time and get and get a new cup
 But this when niggas had pimp cups, and new rappers got hem'd up
 And all them niggas that's biting got they fins cut I know real niggas gon' *** with this
 Like "that's that *** I be talkin' 'bout"
 I know real niggas gon' *** with this
 Like "that's that *** I be talkin' 'bout" And we gon' be around til yo mother***in' body rot
 And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
 And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
 And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got But this when niggas had pimp cups, and dirty money got rinsed up
 And the early birds in the worm hole would get so fat that they'd get stuck
 We'd clean our fingerprints up, we'd clean the *** we didn't touch
 This when niggas called Diddy Puff
 Letting Biggie bump while I'm sitting up in that big body
 I can show you a dead body
 Lotta niggas got pinched, and the snitches ended up dead lobsters
 Wrap the birds in red tape call them bitches Red Robins
 Pops had Kilos, I needed one key I would've made Cops
 Free my niggas down and Rest In Peace to all my dead partners
 I smoke by the pound in like a week, and *** the Weight Watchers
 Got my self a brand new triple-beam, just to weigh options
 I stumbled upon a gold mine I thank God that it ain't copper
 Some niggas were late bloomers, but boy look how they've blossomed
 Don't know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go haywire
 I know hoes that play possum, and will bring us to y'all mailboxes
 And dead man can't talk and the Feds don't have séances
 Look you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her pussy
 And get through customs cause last time we just took em
 I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin'
 And you can beat around the bush and find a nigga laying behind them bushes I know real niggas gon' *** with this
 Like "that's that *** I be talkin' 'bout"
 I know real niggas gon' *** with this
 Like "that's that *** I be talkin' 'bout And we gon' be around til yo mother***in' body rot
 And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
 And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
 And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
