                        It's the weekend hopin we can chill again sort of like we use to
 Cos you know it's over due
 Maybe we can if you ain't got other plans
 I know something we could do
 Girl you know it's overdue

 Last time I saw ya we were together
 Do you remember times that we shared
 Cos I still remember your simple pleasures
 The way that you move and the way that you dance
 It's been too long much to long
 And I can get you off my mind
 So lets hook up like old times
 Hit me up with feets so right

 It's the weekend hopin we can chill again sort of like we use to
 Cos you know it's over due
 Maybe we can if you ain't got other plans
 I know something we could do
 Girl you know it's overdue

 What you been up to
 Are you still single
 Doin the friend thing I like to know
 I wanna see ya so why won't you stop by
 I miss your touch girl I miss your smile
 Its been too long much to long
 And I can get you off my mind
 So lets hook up like old times
 Hit me up with feets so right

 It's the weekend hopin we can chill again sort of like we use to
 Cos you know it's over due
 Maybe we can if you ain't got other plans
 I know something we could do
 Girl you know it's overdue

 It's the weekend hopin we can chill again sort of like we use to
 Cos you know it's over due
 Maybe we can if you ain't got other plans
 I know something we could do
 Girl you know it's overdue

 Monday I can't wait
 Tuesday to see your face
 Wednesday I'll give you a call
 Thursday set it up
 Friday we hook up
 Girl just be ready when we get started

 Baby it's the weekend hopin we can chill again sort of like we use to
 Cos you know it's over due
 Maybe we can if yoy ain't got other plans
 I know something we could do
 Girl you know it's overdue

 It's the weekend hopin we can chill again sort of like we use to
 Cos you know it's over due
 Maybe we can if you ain't got other plans
 I know something we could do
 Girl you know it's overdue
