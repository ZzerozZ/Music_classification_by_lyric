                        Bài hát: Solo Dance - Martin Jensen

In the faded light you touch my body
I can feel your hands on my skin
Think you got me right where you're around me
But you're just in my way
I came the party on my own
Don't need nobody in my soul
I get on to the beat I lose control
Yeah oh I go solo
But you can cool it down
I need to fool around
Just wanna dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
I know you want me
But I don't care baby
Just wanna dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
In the shade of night you're moving closer
We're on our way to cross the line
Think you got me right where you walk me
But it's all in your mind
I came the party on my own
Don't need nobody in my soul
I get on to the beat I lose control
Yeah oh I go solo
But you can cool it down
I need to fool around
Just wanna dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
I know you want me
But I don't care baby
Just wanna dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
