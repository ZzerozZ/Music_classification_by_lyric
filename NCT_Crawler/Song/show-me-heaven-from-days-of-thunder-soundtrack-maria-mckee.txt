                        Bài hát: Show Me Heaven - Maria McKee

There you go flashing fever from your eyes
Hey baby, come over here and shut them tight
I'm not denying, we're flyin' above it all
Hold my hand, don't let me fall
You've such amazing grace, I've never felt this way

Oh, show me heaven
Cover me, leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please

Here I go, I'm shakin' just like the breeze
Hey baby, I need your hand to steady me
I'm not denying, I'm frightened as much as you
Though I'm barely touching you
I've shivers down my spine and it feels divine

Oh, show me heaven
Cover me, leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please

If you know what it's like to dream a dream
Baby, hold me tight and let this be
Oh heaven, cover me, leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please

Show me heaven
Cover me, leave me breathless
Oh, heaven please

Show me heaven
Cover me, leave me breathless
                        
                    |
