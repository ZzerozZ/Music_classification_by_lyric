                        Bài hát : Life Is Too Short (Acoustica Live) - Scorpions

Have you ever seen the morning
When the sun comes up the shore
And the silence makes
A beautiful sound
Have you ever sat there waiting
For the time to stand still
For all the world to stop
From turning around

And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short

Have you ever seen the glowing
When the moon is on the rise
And the dreams are close
To the ones that we love
Have you ever sat there waiting
For heaven to give a sign
So we could find the place
Where angels come from

And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short

There's a time that turns
I'd turn back time
But I don't say I can
It only works if you believe in the truth
Well there's a time to live
And a time to cry
But if you're by my side
I will try to catch a star
I'll try to catch a star
Just for you

And I run
'Cause life is too short
And I run
'Cause life is too short
And I run
'Cause life is too short
And I run
'Cause life is too short

Too short
Too short
Life is too short

Too short
Too short
Life is too short.
