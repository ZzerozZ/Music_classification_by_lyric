                        Bài hát: One Night Only - Performed by Jennifer Hudson, Deena Jones, The Dreams, Dreamgirls

You want all my love and my devotion 
You want my love and soul, right on the line 
I have no doubt that I could love you, forever 
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time 

You've got one night only, one night only 
That's all you have to spare 
One night only 
Let's not pretend to care 
One night only, one night only 
Come on, big baby, come on 
One night only 
We only have 'til dawn 

In the morning this feeling will be gone 
It has no chance going on 
Something so right has got no chance to live 
So let's forget about chances, it's one night I will give 

One night only, one night only 
You'll be the only one 
One night only 
Then you have to run 

One night only, one night only 
There's nothing more to say 
One night only 
Words get in the way 

One night only 
One night only 
One night only...
                        
                    |
