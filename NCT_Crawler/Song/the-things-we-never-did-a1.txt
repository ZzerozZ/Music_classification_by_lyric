                        The things we never did

You and me,
We sit and talk of friendship then I ask,
If you can see
If we could be together, forever

I see the light die in your eyes
Coz you’re scared you’ll hurt
So you don’t want to try

Well take a chance and come home with me
You could stay for eternity
If you try then at least you’ll see
Then you’ll never regret the things we never did

You turn to me, I see your eyes, and somehow they cease to shine
You smile at me yet I can see, you don’t think we can make it

You see the light die in my eyes, coz I’m scared to lose you
I wish you would try

Well take a chance and come home with me
You could stay for eternity
If you try then at least you’ll see
Then you’ll never regret the things we never did

I see the light die in your eyes
Coz you’re scared you’ll hurt
So you don’t wanna try

Well take a chance and come home with me
You could stay for eternity
If you try then at least you’ll see
Then you’ll never regret the things we never did

The things we never did¡
