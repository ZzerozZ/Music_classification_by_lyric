                        Bài hát: When I Close My Eyes - Rhonda Vincent

There's so many things I didn't say
And even though it may be too late
I want you to know, I still love you so

Every car I meet looks like your car
Every movie I see you play the leading part
You're on my mind, can't leave you behind

When I close my eyes you're all I see
In the dark of night you're in my dreams
Throughout the day you're easy to find
You're always there when I close my eyes

In my mind I know you're far away
But here in my heart nothing has changed
I'm still holdin' you like I used to

On a busy street in a crowded room
Wherever I go it's just me and you
Together again, girl it never ends

When I close my eyes you're all I see
In the dark of night you're in my dreams
Throughout the day you're easy to find
You're always there when I close my eyes
You're always there when I close my eyes
                        
                    |
