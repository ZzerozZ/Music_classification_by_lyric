                        Bài hát: The Tide Is High (Get The Feeling) - Atomic Kitten

The tide is high 
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

I'm not the kinda girl 
Who gives up just like that (Oh no)

It's not the things you do
That tease and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things
You do to me
I'm not the kinda girl 
Who gives up just like that o
Oh no

The tide is high 
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high 
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

Number one
Number one

Every girl wants 
You to be her man 
But I'll wait my dear 
'Til it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl 
Who gives up just like that 
Oh no

The tide is high 
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high 
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

Number one
Number one

Every time that I get the feeling
You give me something to believe in
Every time that I got you near me
I don't believe that I want it to be 
But you know that I'm gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen somehow
And you know I can take the pressure
A moment's pain for a lifetime pleasure

Every girl wants you to be her man 
But I'll wait right here
'Til it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl 
Who gives up just like that 
Oh no

The tide is high 
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high 
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

Every time that I get the feeling
You give me something to believe in
Every time that I got you near me
I don't believe that I want it to be 
But you know that I'm gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen somehow
And you know I can take the pressure
A moment's pain for a lifetime pleasure
                        
                    |
