                        Bài hát: We Are Young - Fun.

Give me a second, I 
I need to get my story straight 
My friends are in the bathroom 
Getting higher than the Empire State 
My lover she is waiting for me 
Just across the bar, 
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses 
Asking 'bout a scar 
I know I gave it to you months ago 
I know you're trying to forget 
But between the drinks and subtle things 
And the holes in my apologies 
You know I'm trying hard to take it back 
So if by the time the bar closes 
And you feel like falling down 
I'll carry you home 

Tonight, 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter 
Than the sun 

Tonight, 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter 
Than the sun 

Now I know that I'm not 
All that you got 
I guess that I, 
I just thought, 
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart 
But our friends are back 
So let's raise the cup 
'Cause I found someone to carry me home 

Tonight, 
We are young 
So let's the set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter 
Than the sun 

Tonight, 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter 
Than the sun 

Carry me home tonight 
(La la la la la la) 
Just carry me home tonight 
(La la, la la la la la la) 
Carry me home tonight 
(La la la la la la) 
Just carry me home tonight 
(The world is on my side, ) 
Carry me home tonight 
(I have no reason to run, ) 
Just carry me home tonight 
(So will someone come and carry me home tonight?) 
The angels never arrived, 
But I can hear the choir 
So will someone come and carry me home 

Tonight, 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter 
Than the sun 

Tonight, 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter 
Than the sun 

So if by the time the bar closes 
And you feel like falling down 
I'll carry you home, 
Tonight.
