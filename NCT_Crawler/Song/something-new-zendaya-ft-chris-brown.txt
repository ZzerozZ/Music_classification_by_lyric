                        Bài hát: Something New - Zendaya, Chris Brown

(Intro – Zendaya)
I wanna try something, all night
I wanna try something, all night

(Chorus – Zendaya)
Don’t know your name, but I guess I really don’t care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something

(Verse 1 – Zendaya)
By the way you looking tonight
Only one thing comes to my mind
When the lights come on at 2
I’ll still be moving with you
Boy you’re looking at nobody
Just my body

(Repeat Chorus)

(Post-Chorus – Zendaya)
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, wanna try babe
Ah-ah-ah, all night
Ah-ah-ah, all night babe

(Refrain – Chris Brown)
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Baby, oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Baby, oh I, oh I, oh I

(Verse 2 – Chris Brown)
Baby know what you doing tonight?
I see that look in your eyes
I feel the same, yeah yeah
Miss your lips girl when we kiss
Why don’t we handle this?
Girl you know I need some affection

(Repeat Chorus)

(Post-Chorus – Zendaya & Chris Brown)
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, I wanna try babe
Ah-ah-ah, all night
Ah-ah-ah, all night babe
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, girl if you let me
Ah-ah-ah, all night

(Verse 3 – Zendaya)
This ain’t forever baby, just tonight
Just sit back and take my direction now

(Repeat Post Chorus & Chorus)

(Outro – Zendaya)
I like that new-new boy, I like that new
Wanna try
Give me that new-new boy, give me that new
Wanna try
I like that new boy, I like that new
Wanna try
Give me that new-new boy, give me that new
Wanna try
