                        Came in like the breeze,
 I felt it in my knees
 Never will it leave
 Each day it is retrieved Seems like yesterday
 Your eyes craved this way
 Into my soul you stared
 And bored down every fear We built our own house, own house
 With the hands over our hearts
 And we swore on that day
 That it'll never fall apart We built our own house, own house
 With our hands over our hearts
 And we swore on that day
 That it'll never fall apart
 Will never fall apart-art-art
 Will never fall apart-art-art
 With our hands over our hearts
 Will never fall apart-art-art Wake up to the sun
 Clouds always come undone
 You give the light I need
 Like water to a seed Wading in until
 One to talk to be real
 And prove me wrong it seems
 A heart can truly gleam We built our own house, own house
 With our hands over our hearts
 And we swore on that day
 That it'll never fall apart We built our own house, own house
 With our hands over our hearts
 And we swore on that day
 That it'll never fall apart
 Will never fall apart-art-art
 Will never fall apart-art-art
 With the hands over our hearts
 Will never fall apart-art-art Take it all, take it away
 We'll still have the sun dying
 And the love that is beating
 'Till our lungs stop breathing Take it all, take it away
 We'll still have our riches,
 No need for stitches
 'Cause love melts the pain Take it all, take it away
 Take it all, take it away
 Take it all, take it away
 Take it all, take it away
 Take it all! We built our own house, own house
 With our hands over our hearts
 And we swore on that day
 That it'll never fall apart
 Will never fall apart-art-art
 Will never fall apart-art-art
 With our hands over our hearts
 Will never fall apart-art-art
