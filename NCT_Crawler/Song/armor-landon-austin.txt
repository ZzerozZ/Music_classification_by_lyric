                        Bài hát: Armor - Landon Austin

I’m not bullet proof when it comes to you
Don’t know what to say when you made me the enemy
After the war is won
There’s always the next one
I’m not bullet proof when it comes to you

Maybe I’ll crash into you
Maybe we would open up these wounds
We’re only alive if we bruise
So I lay down this armor
I will surrender tonight
Before we both lose this fight
Take my defenses
All my defenses
I lay down this armor
I lay down this armor
I lay down this armor

I do what it takes to make this right
But we got to stop before the regret
After the war is won
There’s always the next one
I’ll do what it takes to make this right

Maybe I’ll crash into you
Maybe we would open up these wounds
We’re only alive if we bruise
So I lay down this armor
I will surrender tonight
Before we both lose this fight
Take my defenses
All my defenses
I lay down this armor
I lay down this armor
I lay down this armor for you

I’ll be you escape
I’ll be your safe place
I’ll be your shelter
Your shelter yeah
I’ll be you escape
I’ll be your safe place
I’ll be your shelter
Your shelter yeah

Maybe I’ll crash into you
Maybe we would open up these wounds
We’re only alive if we bruise
So I lay down this armor
I will surrender tonight
Before we both lose this fight
Take my defenses
All my defenses
I lay down this armor
I lay down this armor
I lay down this armor for you
I lay down this armor for you
