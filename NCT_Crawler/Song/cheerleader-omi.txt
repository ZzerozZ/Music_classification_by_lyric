                        Bài hát: Cheerleader - Omi

When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stay strong
Yeah yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

[Pre-Hook:]
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Hook x2:]
Oh I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 2:]
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle
Yeah yeah
Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

[Pre-Hook:]
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Hook x2:]
Oh I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 3:]
She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, you're the only girl for me
No I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

[Hook x2:]
Oh I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
                        
                    |
