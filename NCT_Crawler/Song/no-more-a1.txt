                        You say you’re gonna work it out,
Then you say you’re having doubts
Tellin’ me you’ll walk away,
But then you go and stay
You’re callin’ me day and night,
Sayin’ he don’t treat you right
Then you always turn around,
And give him one more try

Baby you know it isn’t fair
You expect me to be there
But we never get nowhere

Chorus:
I got one foot out the door, I don’t wanna hear ‘bout him no more
I’ll make a long story short,
Time to make up your mind girl
No more back and forth, I don’t wanna hear ‘bout him no more
If I’m not what you want, I don’t wanna hear no more


Stop tellin’ me you need more time,
Tired of the same old line
Better make a move or you are gonna find, I ain’t takin' it
Cuz you know it’s wrong,
Better let him know it’s time to go
You’re movin’ on,
Baby you don’t know how close I am to being gone

Really known you long enough
I can only takes so much
Tell me if I have your heart
Baby you know it isn’t fair
You expect me to be there
But we never get nowhere

Chorus:
I got one foot out the door, I don’t wanna hear ‘bout him no more
I’ll make a long story short,
Time to make up your mind girl
No more back and forth, I don’t wanna hear ‘bout him no more
If I’m not what you want, I don’t wanna hear no more


I don’t wanna hear no more,
If you’re sure that you really love me
I don’t wanna hear no more,
Out the door if you still don’t know
I been there for you,
And you know it’s true
You belong with me,
What you gonna do

Chorus:
I got one foot out the door, I don’t wanna hear ‘bout him no more
I’ll make a long story short,
Time to make up your mind girl
No more back and forth, I don’t wanna hear ‘bout him no more
If I’m not what you want, I don’t wanna hear no more
                        
                    |
