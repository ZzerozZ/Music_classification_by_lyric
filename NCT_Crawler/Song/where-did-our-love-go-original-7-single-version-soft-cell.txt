                        Baby, baby, baby don't leave me
 Ooh, please don't leave me all by myself
 I've got this burning, burning, yearning feelin' inside me
 Ooh, deep inside me and it hurts so bad You came into my heart (baby, baby) so tenderly
 With a burning love (baby, baby)
 That stings like a bee (baby, baby)
 Now that I surrender (baby, baby) so helplessly
 You now want to leave (baby, baby)
 Ooh, you wanna leave me (baby, baby)
 Ooh (baby, baby) Baby, baby, where did our love go?
 Ooh, don't you want me?
 Don't you want me no more (baby, baby)?
 Ooh, baby Baby, baby, where did our love go?
 And all your promises of a love forevermore!
 I've got this burning, burning, yearning feelin' inside me
 Ooh, deep inside me, and it hurts so bad Before you won my heart (baby, baby)
 You were a perfect guy
 But now that you got me
 You wanna leave me behind (baby, baby)
 Ooh, baby Baby, baby, baby don't leave me
 Ooh, please don't leave me all by myself (baby, baby)
 Ooh baby, baby, baby
