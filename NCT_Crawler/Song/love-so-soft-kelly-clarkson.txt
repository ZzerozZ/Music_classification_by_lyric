                        Bài hát: Love So Soft - Kelly Clarkson

Yeah 
Every kiss is a door 
Can I knock on yours? Can we knock a little more? 
If your touch is a key 
Keep on twisting, keep on locking, keep on turning me
Let me in 
I wanna be closer to you, let you under my skin 
If I let you in 

You gotta be careful with it 
Let me tell you again, hey 
Love so soft, you ain't had nothing softer 
Break it then you buy it and it sure gonna cost ya 
Love so soft that you can't rub off 
You gon' love it if you try it 
Got you hooked now you're caught up 

Love so soft, so soft (so soft) 
Love so soft, so soft (so soft) 
If your thought was the truth 
We'd be doing all the kinds of things I know you wanna do 
But I need, need to know (need to know) 
Will you protect me, respect me if I let you close?
Let (oh, let) me in (let me in, let me in) 

I wanna be closer to you, let you under my skin 
If I let (if I let) you in (let you in, let you in) 
You gotta be careful with it 
Let me tell you again, hey 
Love so soft, you ain't had nothing softer 
Break it then you buy it and it sure gonna cost ya 
Love so soft that you can't rub off 

You gon' love it if you try it 
Got you hooked now you're caught up 
Love so soft, so soft (so soft) 
Love so soft, so soft (so soft)
If you want this love, got to hold it tight 
Never let it go, baby, let it give you life (let it give you life) 

If you want this love, got to hold it tight 
Never let it go, baby, let it give you life 
Love so soft, you ain't had nothing softer 
Break it then you buy it and it sure gonna cost ya (you ain't had, you ain't had) 
Love so soft that you can't rub off 

You gon' love it if you try it 
Got you hooked now you're caught up 
If you want this love (if you want), got to hold it tight (if you want) 
Never let it go, baby 
Love so soft (so soft) 
Love so soft (so soft) 

If you want this love 
Never let it go, baby 
C'mon love, c'mon, c'mon love 
Love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love 
If you want it baby, so soft, yeah
