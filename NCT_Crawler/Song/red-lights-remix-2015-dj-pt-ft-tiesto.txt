                        Bài hát: Red Lights (Remix 2015) - DJ PT, Tiesto

Blacked out, everything's faded 
On your love I’m already wasted 
So close that I can taste it now... now... 

So let’s break right out of these gilded cages 
We’re gonna make it now... 
Don’t ever turn around 
Don’t ever turn around 

Nobody else needs to know 
Where we might go... 
We could just run them red lights 
We could just run them red lights 

There ain’t no reason to stay 
We’ll be light years away... 
We could just run them red lights 
We could just run them red lights 

We could just run them red lights... 
We could just run them red lights... 

White lights, flirt in the darkness 
This road leads where your heart is 
These signs, something we can’t ignore...no... 

We can’t back down 
We’ll never let them change us 
We’re gonna make it now 
What are we waiting for... 
What are we waiting for... 

Nobody else needs to know 
Where we might go... 
We could just run them red lights 
We could just run them red lights 

There ain’t no reason to stay 
We’ll be light years away... 
We could just run them red lights 
We could just run them red lights 

We could just run them red lights... 
We could just run them red lights...
                        
                    |
