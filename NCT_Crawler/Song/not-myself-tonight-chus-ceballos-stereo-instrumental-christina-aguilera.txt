You know tonight
I am feeling a little out control
is this me
you wanna get crazy
because I don't give a...

I'm out of character
I'm in rare form
and If you really knew me
you'd know its not the norm

Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
the old me's gone I feel brand new
and if you don't like it *** you

The music's on and I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care cause this is my night

I'm not myself tonight
tonight I'm not the same girl same girl
I'm not myself tonight
tonight I'm not the same girl same girl

I'm dancing alot and I'm taking shots I'm feeling fine
I'm kissing all the boys and the girls
someone call the doctor cause I lost my mind

Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
the old me's gone I feel brand new
and if you don't like it *** you

The music's on and I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care cause this is my night

I'm not myself tonight
tonight I'm not the same girl same girl

I'm not myself tonight
tonight I'm not the same girl same girl

In the morning
when I wake Up
I'll go back to the girl I used to be
but baby not tonight

I'm not myself tonight
tonight I'm not the same girl same girl

I'm not myself tonight
tonight I'm not the same girl same girl

Yah, that feels good
I needed that
get crazy
let's go
[that's right
come on
give it to me now, don't stop
