                        Bài hát: Back To You (From 13 Reasons Why - Season 2 Soundtrack) - Selena Gomez

[Verse 1]
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with the cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you (feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it, even though I do (even though I do)

[Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know its forward but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I’m lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me (’Cause it’s not me)
And what's the point in hiding
And everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I regret it if I didn’t say this isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

[Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know its forward but it's true
I wanna hold you when I’m not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
What was there wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Bridge]
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know its forward but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use
I know I'd go back to you

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
