                        Bài hát: Happy Christmas (War Is Over) - Maroon 5 

So this is Christmas
And what have you done?
Another year over
A new one just begun

And so this is Christmas
I hope you had fun
Near and the dear one
The old and the young

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

So this is Christmas
For weak and for strong
For rich and the poor ones
The world is so wrong

And so happy Christmas
For black and for white
Yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas
What have we done?
Another year over
A new one just begun

And so happy Christmas
We hope you had fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

War is over
If you want it
War is over
Now
