                        Bài hát: Landslide - Oh Wonder

I know it hurts sometimes but
You'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
But you'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I know your hope is heavy but
You'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
And I know you feel like everything
Is falling to the wind
But don't you let the thunder in
Cause I...
