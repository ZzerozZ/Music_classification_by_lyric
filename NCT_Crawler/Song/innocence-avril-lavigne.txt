                        Waking up I see that everything is OK 
The first time in my life and now it's so great 
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed 
I think about the little things that make life great 

I wouldn't change a thing about it 
This is the best feeling 

[Chorus] 
This innocence is brilliant 
I hope that it will stay 
This moment is perfect 
Please don't go away 
I need you now 
And I'll hold on to it 
Don't you let it pass you by 

I found a place so safe, not a single tear 
The first time in my life and now it's so clear 
Feel calm, I belong, I'm so happy here 
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere 

I wouldn't change a thing about it 
This is the best feeling 

[Chorus] 

It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming 
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling 
It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry 
It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming 
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling 
It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry 

It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry 
This innocence is brilliant 
Makes you wanna cry 
This innocence is brilliance 
Please don't go away 
Cause I need you now 
And I'll hold on to it 
Don't you let it pass you by 

[Chorus]
                        
                    |
