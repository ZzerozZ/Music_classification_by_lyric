                        Bài hát: I Took a Pill in Ibiza (Seeb Remix) - Mike Posner

I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older
But *** it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be
All alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing

All I know
Are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know
Are sad songs, sad songs

I know, are sad songs
I know, are sad songs
I know, are sad songs
I know, are sad songs

I'm just a singer
Who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers cause my name's a reminder
Of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

And you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be
All alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing

All I know
Are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know
Are sad songs, sad songs

I know, are sad songs
I know, are sad songs
Sad songs
I know, are sad songs
Sad songs
I know, are sad songs
