                        Bài hát: Colour Me - Juke Ross

Here we are again
Fading light
Those gleaming eyes and freckled smile light up the night
Here we are alone
My lips on yours
The taste of candy and salt drives me for more
Tied to my urn with your ball-point pen
Say you love me again and again
There will never be an end
To this love my dear friend

You, colour me
You colour my soul
Paint me red in places once filled with gold
You, colour me
You colour my soul
Make me dream of things I never did once before

Here we are again
Telling me its my fault
Things I dont understand, things beyond control
Here we are alone
You resting by my side
Those broken glass shatter me and cloud my mind
Before you stab my heart with your ball-point pen
Say you love me again and again
There will never be an end
To this love my dear friend

You, colour me
You colour my soul
Paint me red in places once filled with gold
You, colour me
You colour my soul
Made me dream of things I never did once before

Lipstick stains on these clothes of mine
Hold your scent frozen in time
Lipstick stains on these clothes of mine
Hold your love frozen in time

You, colour me
You colour my soul
Paint me red in places once filled with gold
You, colour me
You colour my soul
Make me dream of things I never did once before
You
                        
                    |
