                        You feel bad, but not bad enough
 You know you had it coming 'cause you played so rough
 Back over your shoulder got an icy chill
 Man, you thought you'd get away with it
 Now you know you never will

 Somebody, somebody
 You got a feelin' somebody's following you

 No one knows 'bout the times you had
 You've been so evil; you know, you've been so bad
 There's a devil to pay for what you put them through
 And you got a feeling somebody's following you

 Somebody, somebody
 You got a feelin' somebody's following you
 Somebody, somebody
 You got a feelin' somebody's following you

 There's a jack-o-lantern moon in the midnight sky
 Somebody gonna live, somebody gonna die
 But down in the graveyard on that old tombstone
 There's a big black crow and it's callin' you home

 Somebody, somebody
 You got a feelin' somebody's following you
 Somebody, somebody
 You got a feelin' somebody's following you
 Somebody
 You know there's somebody
                        
                    |
