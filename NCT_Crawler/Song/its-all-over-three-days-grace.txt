                        Bài hát: It's All Over - Three Days Grace

 Your bottle's almost empty
 You know this can't go on
 Because of you
 My mind is always racing The needles' breaking your skin
 The scar is sinking in
 And now your trip begins
 But it's all over for, it's all over For you, for you
 When you're on the edge and falling off
 It's all over for you, for you
 When you're on the edge and falling off
 It's all over I know what runs through your blood
 You do this all in vain
 Because of you
 My mind is always racing And it gets under my skin
 To see you giving it
 And now your trip begins
 But it's all over for, it's all over For you, for you
 When you're on the edge and falling off
 It's all over for you, for you
 When you're on the edge and falling off
 It's all over And now you're dead inside
 Still you wonder why
 It's all over
 And now you're dead inside
 Still you wonder why
 It's all over And now you're dead inside
 Still you wonder why
 When you're on the edge and falling off
 It's all over for
 (You, for you) And now you're dead inside
 Still you wonder why
 When you're on the edge and falling off
 It's all over for
 (You, for you) And now you're dead inside
 Still you wonder why
 It's all over
