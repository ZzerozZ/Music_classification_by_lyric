                        Bài hát: Hurry Up And Save Me - Nightcore

I'm going through the same day
Same place, same way I always do
Then I saw you from the corner of my eye
And it hit me like a top and I can't lie
Oh you go to me
My life was alright living in black and white
But you changed my point of view
Show me your colors
Show me your colors
Cuz without you I'm blue
(Without you I'm blue)
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you
(Show me your colors
Show me your colors)
I have to have control of myself
My thoughts my mind
That's the way it's going down
In my life I feel like a prisoner
In a light
Are you feeling me
Cuz the way you make my
Break my shake my walls around
I feel like I'm breaking up
Show me your colors
Show me your colors
Cuz without you I'm blue
(Without you I'm blue)
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you
(Hurry hurry up)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me (Save you)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you
My window's opened up
Tonight I'm going down
Will you be there are you waiting
Will you be there will you save me
(So just leave me, so just leave me)
(Save me, save me) You can save me
(Save me, save me) I know you can save me
So just, so just save me
Without you I'm blue
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you
Hurry up and save me (I'm blue)
Hurry up and save me (Are you)
Hurry up and save me (Are you)
Hurry up and save me (Are you)
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you
Hurry up and save me (Save you)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me (Save you)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you (Save you)
Save me, save me
