                        Bài hát : Honeymoon Avenue - Ariana Grande

I looked in my rearview mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah.
I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn 
Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And You decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck
In bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was

Hey, what happened to the butterflies
Guess they were moving kinda fast, that time
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we found it
Well that's when we start turnin around
You're saying baby don't worry
But we're still going the wrong way 

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck
In bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was

They say only fools fall in love
Well they must've been talking about us
Sometimes I feel like
I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We gon' be lost
If we continue to fight
Honey I know, yeah
We can find our way home

I feel like my heart is stuck
In bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
My baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was

You know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck
In bumper ... 
Traffic, I'm under pre-pre-pressure, pressure
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on ...
Let's just go back, b-b-back, back, back
                        
                    |
