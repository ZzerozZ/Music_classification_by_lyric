One, two, three, four
Can I have a little more?
five, six, seven eight nine ten I love you.
A, B, C, D
Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G H I J I love you.
Sail the ship, Jump the tree
Skip the rope, Look at me
All together now....
Black, white, green, red
Can I take my friend to bed?
Pink, brown, yellow orange blue I love you
All together now....
Sail the ship, Jump the tree
Skip the rope, Look at me
All together now....
