                        I'm not like them
 But I can pretend
 The sun is gone
 But I have a light
 The day is done
 And I'm having fun
 I think I'm dumb
 Maybe just happy I think I'm just happy
 I think I'm just happy
 I think I'm just happy My heart is broke
 But I have some glue
 Help me inhale
 And mend it with you
 We'll float around
 And hang out on clouds
 Then we'll come down
 And have a hangover Have a hangover
 Have a hangover
 Have a hangover Skin the sun
 Fall asleep
 Wish away
 Soul is cheap
 Lesson learned
 Wish me luck
 Soothe the burn
 Wake me up I'm not like them
 But I can pretend
 The sun is gone
 But I have a light
 The day is done
 And I'm having fun
 I think I'm dumb
 Maybe just happy I think I'm just happy
 I think I'm just happy
 I think I'm just happy I think I'm dumb (x12)
