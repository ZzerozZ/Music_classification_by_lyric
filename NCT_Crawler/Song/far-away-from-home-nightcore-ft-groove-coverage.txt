                        Bài hát: Far Away From Home - Nightcore, Groove Coverage

I am loving living every single day but sometimes I feel so. 
I hope to find a little peace of mind and I just want to know. 
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be. 
Where is home on the Milky way of stars, I dry my eyes again. 

In my dreams I am not so far away from home. 
What am I in a world so far away from home. 
All my life all the time so far away from home. 
Without you I will be so far away from home. 

If we could make it through the darkest night we have a brighter day. 
The world I see beyond your pretty eyes, makes me want to stay. 
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be. 
Where is home on the Milky way of stars, I dry my eyes again. 

In my dreams I am not so far away from home. 
What am I in a world so far away from home. 
All my life all the time so far away from home. 
Without you I will be so far away from home. 

I count on you, no matter what they say, cause love can find it time. 
I hope to be a part of you again, baby let us shine. 
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be. 
Where is home on the Milky way of stars, I dry my eyes again. 

In my dreams I am not so far away from home. 
What am I in a world so far away from home. 
All my life all the time so far away from home. 
Without you I will be so far away from home. 

In my dreams I am not so far away from home. 
What am I in a world so far away from home. 
All my life all the time so far away from home. 
Without you I will be so far away from home.
