                        Pressure
Paremore
All We Know Is Falling
Tell me where our time went
And if it was time well spent
Just don't let me fall asleep
Feeling empty again
Cause I fear I might break
and I fear I can't take it
Tonight I'll lie awake feeling empty
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
Now that I'm losing hope
And there's nothing else to show
For all of the days that we spent
Carried away from home
Somethings I'll never know
And I had to let them go
I'm sitting all alone feeling empty
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
Without you
Somethings I'll never know
And I had to let them go
Somethings I'll never know
And I had to let them go
I'm sitting all alone feeling empty
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
Feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
You're better off without me
