                        If I should die this very moment, I wouldn't fear
 For I've never known completeness like being here
 Wrapped in the warmth of you, loving every breath of you
 Still my heart this moment, oh it might burst Could we stay right here till the end of time
 Until the earth stops turning
 Wanna love you until the seas run dry
 I've found the one I've waited for All this time I've loved you and never known your face
 All this time I've missed you and searched this human race
 Here is true peace here my heart knows calm
 Safe in your soul bathed in your sighs Wanna stay right here till the end of time
 Till the earth stops turning
 Gonna love you until the seas run dry
 I've found the one I've waited for, the one I've waited for All I've known, all I've done
 All I've felt was leading to this
 All I've known, all I've done
 All I've felt was leading to this Wanna stay right here
 Till the end of time till the earth stops turning
 Gonna love you till the seas run dry
 I've found the one I've waited for, the one I've waited for Wanna stay right here
 Till the end of time, till the earth stops turning
 Gonna love you till the seas run dry
 I've found the one I've been waited for, the one I've waited for The one I've waited for
