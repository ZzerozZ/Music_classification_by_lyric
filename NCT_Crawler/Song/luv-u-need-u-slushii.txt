                        Bài hát: Luv U Need U - Slushii

[Verse 1]
All I wanna do is to put my arms around you
And though she's moving slow, back into place
All I wanna do is to make you stop and love me
How can I be blue when you catch me in this feeling like
O-o-oo-o
O-o-oo-ou-hu-huu
O-o-oo-o

[Chorus]
O-o-o-Okay
I love you, love you, I do
I need you, need you, I do
I love you, love, I do
I need you, need
I love you, love you, I do
I need you, you
I love you, love, I do
I need you, ooh
I love you, love you, I do
I need you, need you, I do
I love you, love, I do
I need you, need
I love you, love, I do
I need you, ooh
I love you, love, I do
I need you, ooh

All I wanna do is to put my arms around you
And though she's moving slow, back into place
All I wanna do is to make you stop and love me
How can I be blue when you catch me in this feeling like
O-o-oo-o
O-o-oo-ou-hu-huu
O-o-oo-o

[Chorus]
O-o-o-Okay
I love you, love you, I do
I need you, need you, I do
I love you, love, I do
I need you, need
I love you, love you, I do
I need you, you
I love you, love, I do
I need you, ooh
I love you, love you, I do
I need you, need you, I do
I love you, love, I do
I need you, need
I love you, love, I do
I need you, ooh
I love you, love, I do
I need you, ooh
