                        Bài hát: How Do You Do - Nightcore

I see you comb your hair and gimme that 
grin. 
It's making me spin now, spinnin' within. 
Before I melt like snow, I say Hello - 
How do you do! 
I love the way you undress now. 
Baby begin. 
Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a 
mess. 
I love your blue-eyed voice, 
like Tiny Tim shines thru. 
How do you do!

How do you do, do you do, the things that you do. 
No one I know could ever keep up with you. 
How do you do! 
Did it ever make sense to you to say Bye 
Bye Bye? 
How do you do, do you do, the things that you do. 
No one I know could ever keep up with you. 
How do you do! 
Did it ever make sense to you to say Bye 
Bye Bye?

I see you in that chair with the perfect 
skin. 
Well how have you been, baby, livin' in 
sin? 
Hey, I gotta know, did you say Hello - 
How do you do? 
Well, here we are spending time in the 
louder part of town 
and it feels like everything's surreal. 
When I get old I will wait outside your 
house 
cos your hands have got the power meant to 
heal. 
How do you do, do you do, the things that 
you do. 
No one I know could ever keep up with you. 
How do you do! 
Did it ever make sense to you to say Bye 
Bye Bye?
How do you do, do you do, the things that 
you do. 
No one I know could ever keep up with you. 
How do you do! 
Did it ever make sense to you to say Bye 
Bye Bye?
How do you do, do you do, the things that 
you do. 
No one I know could ever keep up with you. 
How do you do! 
Did it ever make sense to you to say Bye 
Bye Bye?
