                        Bài hát: Stay - Miley Cyrus

Well it's good to hear your voice
I hope you're doing fine
And if you ever wonder
I'm lonely here tonight

I'm lost here in this moment
And time keeps slipping by
And if I could have just one wish
I'd have you by my side

Ohhhh
I miss you
Ohhhh
I need you

And I love you more
Than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed
No one could take your place
It gets harder every day

Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home
I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay
I will stay

Well I try to live without you
But tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God, I'm torn apart inside
I look up at the stars
Hoping you're doing the same
And somehow I'll feel closer
And I can hear you say

Ohhhh
I miss you
Ohhhh
I need you

I love you more
Than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed
No one could take your place
It gets harder every day

Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay

I will stay
Always stay
I never want to lose you
And if I do, I would choose you
So stay
Please always stay
You're the one that I hold on to
Cause my heart would stop without you

I love you more than I did before
Than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed
No one could take your place
It gets harder every day

Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay
I will stay
I'll always stay

And I love you more than I did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask, I will stay
I will stay
I will stay
