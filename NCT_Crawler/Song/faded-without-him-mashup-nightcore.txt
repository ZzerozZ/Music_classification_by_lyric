                        Bài hát: Faded - Without Him (Mashup) - Nightcore

Right from the start he lured me in 
Took me to places I'd never been 
I think I'm in love 
I think I'm in love 

He might have bent me but I didn't break 
He rearranged the map I made 
But I think I'm in love 
I think I'm in love 

Now am I crazy, why can no one understand? 
That I'll never find a better man (Oh no) 
I'm just imagining a life without my baby 
And I know, I know 
This life ain't meant to be lived without him, without him 
I know, I know 
This life ain't meant to be lived without him, without him 
This life ain't meant to be lived without him, without him 
I know 

They say this is America 
Free speech, free will but I don't even care at all 
Can't seem to fight this, needing him every day and night 
Why can't I just try to speak my mind to him? 

Tell him all the things that he probably thought was coming 
But didn't want him thinking that I'm trying to rush it 
Please dear God, give me the words 
Cause you know my tongue ties as soon as I see him blushing 

I get my thoughts, put it all on a page 
I might get to find a way out of the maze 
That I built for myself in some kind of haze 
And if the right words come to me one by one 

I hope he tells me that he loves me the same 
I hope he don't laugh, or worse walk away 
Cause the honest to God, truth of the matter 
Is I just can't live my life without you 

Right from the start he lured me in 
Took me to places I'd never been 
I think I'm in love 
I think I'm in love (Oh no) 

He might have bent me but I didn't break 
He rearranged the map I made 
But I think I'm in love 
I think I'm in love (Oh, oh no) 

Now am I crazy, why can no one understand? 
That I'll never find a better man (Oh no) 
I'm just imagining a life without my baby 
And I know, I know 
This life ain't meant to be lived without him, without him 
This life ain't meant to be lived without him, without him 
I know 

I'm not one to really talk at all 
Speak up only when the time is right or when it calls 
For the big guns, problem is where to speak from 
I hear it's your heart that does all the talking 

Hurry up you got no time to waste 
Cause this is the man I'm loving for always 
And the honest to God, truth of the matter 
I just can't see my life going on without you 

Now am I crazy, why can no one understand? 
That I'll never find a better man (Oh no, oh no no no no) 
I'm just imagining a life without my baby 
And I know, I know 
This life ain't meant to be lived without him (yeah), without him (yeah) 
This life ain't meant to be lived without him, without him 
I know
