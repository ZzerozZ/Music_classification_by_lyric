                        Bài hát: Honest - Future

Dark Marzal on me I'm just honest
 Rock star my swag I'm just honest
 Everything exotic I'm just honest
 Gold all on my neck I'm just honest
 Yeah, I'm just honest
 We got the club on smash Name another nigga hot I'm just honest
 Gold bottles on bottles, I'm just honest
 A hundred thousand on watches I'm just honest
 Coupes all on coupes, I'm just honest
 I keep a gang of bad bitches with me too
 And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
 I was gon lie to you but I had to tell the truth
 I'm just being honest My piss coming back dirty, I'm just being honest
 Got bitches kissing on bitches, I'm just being honest
 I'm a rock star for life, I'm just being honest
 Got a check on me right now, I'm just being honest
 We done turnt up in Platinum, then we gon hit Onyx
 Ain't nothing but a dope boy, I'm just being honest
 These niggas get shot for being honest
 I *** her on the spot, I'm just being honest
 I'mma stack it til it rot, I'm just being honest
 And I'm driving foreign coupes, dash two hundred
 Live a rich nigga life, I'm just being honest
 Real street nigga ain't get nothing but pain from it Name another nigga hot I'm just honest
 Gold bottles on bottles, I'm just honest
 A hundred thousand on watches I'm just honest
 Coupes all on coupes, I'm just honest
 I keep a gang of bad bitches with me too
 And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
 I was gon lie to you but I had to tell the truth
 I'm just being honest Got crack all in my draws, I'm just honest
 My diamonds ain't got flaws, I'm just honest
 These Zoes on sight niggas, I'm just honest
 We can ball all night nigga, I'm just honest
 You *** nigga ya'll don't even know struggle
 You ain't even know why a nigga out here hustling
 Got flat screens in the trap spot, I'm honest
 Kept it real with all you niggas, I'm just too honest
 Took some bitches out the strip club, I'm just honest
 To the niggas all out in the hood, I'm just honest
 Lil Mexico for life, I'm just honest
 I came up shooting dice, I'm just honest Name another nigga hot I'm just honest
 Gold bottles on bottles, I'm just honest
 A hundred thousand on watches I'm just honest
 Coupes all on coupes, I'm just honest
 I keep a gang of bad bitches with me too
 And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
 I was gon lie to you but I had to tell the truth
 I'm just being honest
