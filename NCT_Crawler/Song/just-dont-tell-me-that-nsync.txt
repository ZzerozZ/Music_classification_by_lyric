                        Oh Oh, No no, Alright

You like to be seen
At every party at the Playboy Mansion
Fun, sad
I know I gotta draw the line
You wanna be in the flashes of light
Holding me tight
With your phony laugh
I guess you gotta be photographed

You can say it's real
But I know where's it's at

Just don't tell me that
You were gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You don't gotta tell me that
It's gonna be your last lie
No baby, I won't go for that
Even if you did say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
Cause it's not about love
Just dont tell me that...

You like to drive in my Jag
And spend, every dollar of my credit, baby
Guess, what hit me with your golden eye
I guess you wanna be part of the ride
Live with the night
But I've seen it through
I've had enough of being close to you

You can say it's real
But I know where it's at

Just don't tell me that
You were gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You don't have tell me that
It's gonna be your last lie
No baby, I won't go for that
Even if you did say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
Cause it's not about love
Just dont tell me that...

No, no
It's not about love
No, no
You wanna be in the flashes of light
Holding me tight
Girl, it's all up to you
But whatever you do
I don't wanna hear it

You're not gonna love me
I won't go for that
It just won't happen
Even if you say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
Cause it's not about love

Just don't tell me that
You were gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You don't gotta tell me that
It's gonna be your last lie
No baby, I won't go for that
Even if you did say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
Cause it's not about love
Just dont tell me that...
