                        Song: When You're Looking Like That - Westlife

She's a 5 foot 10 in catsuit and bambi eyes
Everybody's who's staring wouldn't believe that this girl was mine
I should have know I was wrong
When I left her for a life in pity
But they say you never miss the water until it's gone

Guess I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't want to get lost
I don't want to live my life without you
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that

She's all dressed up for glamour and rock and roll
want to squeeze her real tight get out of this place
If only I could take control

But she is out of my reach forever
And just a week ago she lied next to me
It's so ironic how I had to lose just
To see that I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't want to get lost
I don't want to live my life without you
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that

I don't want to forget you
I don't even want to try
How am I supposed to walk on by when you're looking like that

How am I supposed to leave you now
I can't believe what I just gave away (oh no)
Now I can't take it back
I don't want to get lost
I don't want to live my life with out you
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that
