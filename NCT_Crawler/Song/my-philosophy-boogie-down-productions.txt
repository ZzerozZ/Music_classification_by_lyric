                        Let's begin
 What, where, why, or when
 Will all be explained
 Why destruction is a game
 See I'm not insane
 In fact, I'm kind of rational
 When I be asking
 Yo, who is more dramatical
 This one, that one
 The white one or the black one
 Pick the punk
 And I'll jump up to attack one
 KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew
 Right up to your face and dis you
 Everyone saw me on the last album cover
 Holding a pistol
 Something far from a lover
 Beside my brother
 S-C-O-T
 I just laughed
 'Cause no one can defeat me
 This selection number two
 Is 'My Philosophy'
 Number one
 Was 'Poetry'
 You know it's me
 It's my philosophy
 Many artists got to learn
 I'm not flammable
 I don't burn
 So please stop burnin'
 And learn to earn respect
 'Cause that's just what
 KR collects
 See, what do you expect
 When you rhyme like a soft punk
 You walk down the street and get jumped
 You got to have style
 And learn to be original
 And everybody's gonna wanna dis you
 Like me
 We stood up for the South Bronx
 And every sucka mc
 Had a response
 You think we care?
 I know that they are on the tip
 My posse from the Bronx is thick
 And we're real live
 We walk correctly
 A lot of suckas would like to forget me
 But they can't
 'Cause like a champ
 I have got a record
 Of knocking out the frauds in a second
 On the mic
 I believe that you should get loose
 I haven't come to tell you I have juice
 I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level
 I'll be back
 But for now just seckle
 Verse two
 I'll play the nine
 And you play the target
 You all know my name so I guess I'll just start it
 Or should I say, 'Start this'
 I am an artist
 Of new concepts at their hardest
 Yo, cause I'm a teacher
 And Scot is a scholar
 It ain't about money
 Cause we all make dollars
 That's why
 I walk with my head up
 When I hear wack rhymes
 I get fed up
 Rap is like a set-up
 A lot of games
 A lot of suckas with colorful names
 I'm so-and-so
 I'm this
 I'm that
 Huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack
 I'm not white or red or black
 I'm brown
 From the Boogie Down
 Productions
 Of course
 Our music be thumpin'
 Others say their bad
 But they're buggin
 Let me tell you somethin' now
 About hip hop
 About D-Nice, Melodie
 And Scot La Rock
 I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker
 Mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker
 Some mc's be talkin' and talkin'
 Tryin' to show how black people are walkin But I don't walk this way to portray
 Or reinforce
 Stereotypes of today
 Like all my brothas
 Eatin' chicken and watermelon
 Talk broken english and drug sellin'
 See I'm tellin'
 And teaching real facts
 Now when some act in rap
 Is kind of wack
 And it lacks
 Creativity and intelligence
 But they don't care
 'Cause the company is sellin' it
 It's my philosophy
 On the industry
 Don't bother dissin' me
 Or even wish that we'd
 Soften, dilute
 Or commercialize all our lyrics
 'Cause it's about time
 One of y'all hear it
 First-hand
 From the intelligent
 Brown man
 A vegetarian
 No goat or ham
 Or chicken or turkey or hamburger
 'Cause to me that's suicide
 Self-murder
 Let us get back to what we call hip hop
 And what it meant to DJ Scot La Rock
 Verse three
 How many mc's must get dissed
 Before somebody says, 'Don't f*** with Kris!'
 This is just one style
 Out of many
 Like a piggy bank
 This is one penny
 My brother's name is Kenny
 Kenny Parker
 My other brother I.C.U
 Is much darker
 Boogie Down Productions
 Is made up of teachers
 The lecture is conducted
 From the mic into the speaker
 Who gets weaker?
 The king or the teacher
 It's not about a salary
 It's all about reality
 Teachers teach and do the world good
 Kings just rule
 And most are never understood
 If you were to rule
 Over a certain industry
 **** Right now
 Would be in misery
 No one would get along
 Nor sing a song
 'Cause everyone'd be singing for the king
 Am I wrong?
 So yo, what's up
 It's me again
 Scot La Rock
 KRS, BDP again
 Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
 We're criminal minded
 And only tend
 Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records
 No more than four minutes
 And some seconds
 The competition checks and checks
 And keeps checkin'
 They get the album
 Take it home
 And start sweatin'
 Why? well it's simple
 To them it's kind of vital
 To take KRS-One's title
 To them I'm like an idol
 Some type of entity
 In everybody's rhyme
 They wanna mention me?
 Or rather mention us
 Me or Scot La Rock
 But they can get bust
 Get robbed, get dropped
 I don't play around
 Nor do I f*** around
 And you can tell by the bodies that are left around
 When some clown jumps up to get beat down
 Broken down to his very last compound
 See how it sound?
 A little unrational
 A lot of mc's like to use the word
 DRAMATICAL
 Fresh for '88
 You suckas
                        
                    |
