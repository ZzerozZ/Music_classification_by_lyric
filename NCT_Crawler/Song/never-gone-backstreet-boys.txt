                        I really miss you, there's something I gotta say

The things we did, the things we said
Keep comin' back to me and make me smile again
You showed me how to face the truth
Everything that's good in me I owe to you

Though the distance that's between us
Now may seem to be too far
It will never separate us
Deep inside, I know you are

Chorus:
Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close, everyday
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye
I know you would be forever in my life (yeah!)
Never gone

No, no, no, no

I walk along these empty streets
There is not a second you're not here with me
The love you gave, the grace you've shown
Will always give me strength and be my cornerstone

(Somehow) somehow you found a way
To see the best I have in me
As long as time goes on
I swear to you that you will be

Chorus:
Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close (always close), everyday (everyday yeah)
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye
I know you would be forever in my life (in my life, yeah)

Never gone (gone from me)
If there's one thing I believe (I believe)
I will see you somewhere down the road again
(I will see you somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere)

(Never gone) Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close (always close, always close), everyday (everyday, everyday)
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye (yeah, yeah)
I know you would be forever in my life

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are (in my heart is where you are)
Always close (always close), everyday (everyday)
Every step along the way

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
                        
                    |
