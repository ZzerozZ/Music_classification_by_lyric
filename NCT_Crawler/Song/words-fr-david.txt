                        Words, don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I Love You
Words don't come easy

Words, don't come easy to me
This is the only way for me to say I Love You
Words don't come easy

Well I'm just a music man
Melody's so far my best friend
But my words are coming out wrong and I
I reveal my heart to you and
Hope that you believe it's true cause

Words, don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I love You
Words don't come easy

This is just a simple song
That I've made for you on my own
There's no hidden meaning you know when I
When I say I love you honey
Please believe I really do cause

Words, don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I Love You
Words don't come easy

It isn't easy
Words don't come easy

Words, don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I Love You
Words don't come easy

Don't come easy to me
This is the only way for me to say I Love You
Words don't come easy

Words don't come easy
