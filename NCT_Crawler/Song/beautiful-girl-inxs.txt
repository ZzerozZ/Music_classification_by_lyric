                        Nicky's in the corner
 With a black coat on
 Running from a bad home
 With some cat inside
 Now where did you find her
 Among the neon lights
 That haunt the streets outside, she says
 Stay with me Beautiful girl (stay with me)
 Beautiful girl (stay with me)
 She wanna go home From doorway to doorway
 Street corner to corner
 With neon ghosts in the city
 And she says Stay with me
 Stay with me
 Stay with me
 Stay with me (Stay with me, stay with me) She's so scared
 So very frightened
 Anything could happen
 Right here tonight Beautiful girl (stay with me)
 Beautiful girl (stay with me)
 She wants to go home Stay with me (beautiful girl)
 Stay with me (beautiful girl)
 Stay with me (beautiful girl)
 Stay with me, beautiful girl
