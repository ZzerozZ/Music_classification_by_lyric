                        Tell me, none of your longings
 I don't need them, or you
 And leave me, none of your wisdom
 I don't need your lies, or your truths

 I've been better, when the sky was red
 And a face like yours couldn't make me scared
 I've been better, with the things I've said
 When I took the lead instead of being led

 Feed me, none of your lines
 I won't fall for them, 'cause I'll lose
 And hold me, to none of my words
 I don't mean them, when I'm with you

 And the cars streak past with a life inside
 Why is my life in your eyes?
 And the windows glow with the hearts they've known
 Why is my heart never mine?

 I've been better, when the sky was red
 And a face like yours couldn't make me scared
 I've been better, with the things I've said
 When I took the lead instead of being led
 [X2]

 I've been better, when the sky was red
 And a face like yours couldn't make me scared
 I've been better, with the things I've said
 When I took the lead instead of being led
 [X2]

 I been better, been better, oh oh oh
 Been better, I been better, oh oh oh
 I been better, I been better, oh oh oh
 Been better, been better, oh oh oh
