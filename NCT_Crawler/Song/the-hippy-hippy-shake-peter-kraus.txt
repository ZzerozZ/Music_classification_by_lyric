For Goodness' sake
I got the Hippy Hippy Shakes

Ooh, I can't sit still

Yeah, it's in the bag

Ooh, the Hippy Hippy Shake

Well, now, you shake it to the left
You shake it to the right
Do the Hippy Shake Shake
With all of your might

Ooh, baby
Ooh, yeah come on and shake
Ooh, it's in the bag
Oh,The Hippy Hippy Shake

Well, now you shake it to the left
Shake it to the right

with all of your might

oh baby yeah come on shake
oh it's in the bag
Ooh, the Hippy Hippy Shake
Ooh, the Hippy Hippy Shake
