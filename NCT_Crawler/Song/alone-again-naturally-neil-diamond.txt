                        Title: Alone Again (Naturally)
Artist: Neil Diamond


In a little while from now, 
If I'm not feeling anyless sour ,
I promise myself to treat myself 
And visit a nearby tower 
And climbing to the top will throw myself off, 
In an effort to make it clear to who 
Ever what it's like when you're shattered.

Left standing in the lurch at a church,
Where people saying 'my God 
that's tough she's stood him up 
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home'. 
As I did on my own. 
Alone again, naturally. 

To think that only yesterday 
I was cheerful, bright and gay, 
Looking forward to- well who wouldn't do 
The role I was about to play.

But as if to knock me down, 
Reality came around.
And without so much 
As a mere touch 
Cut me into little pieces 
Leaving me to doubt 
Talk about God in his mercy 
Who if he really does exist, 
Why did he desert me in my hour of need? 
I truly am indeed 
Alone again, naturally. 

It seems to me that there are more hearts 
Broken in the world that can't be mended. 
Left unattende
What do we do?
What do we do? 

Now looking back over the years 
And whatever else that appears. 
I remember I cried when my father died 
Never wishing to hide the tears. 

And at sixty-five years old 
My mother God rest her soul.
Couldn't understand why the only man 
She had ever loved had been taken, 
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken, 
Despite encouragemant from me no words were ever spoken 
And when she passed away 
I cried and cried all day 
Alone again, naturally.

Alone again, natually.
