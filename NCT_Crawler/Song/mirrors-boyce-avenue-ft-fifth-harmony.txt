                        Bài hát: Mirrors - Boyce Avenue, Fifth Harmony

Aren't you somethin' to admire? 
Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror 
And I can't help but notice 
You reflect in this heart of mine 
If you ever feel alone and 
The glare makes me hard to find 
Just know that I'm always 
Parallel on the other side 

Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 

It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside of me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me 

Aren't you somethin', an original 
Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled 
And I can't help but stare, cause 
I see truth somewhere in your eyes 
I can't ever change without you 
You reflect me, I love that about you 
And if I could, I 
Would look at us all the time 

Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 

I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 

It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside of me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me 

Yesterday is history 
Tomorrow's a mystery 
I can see you lookin' back at me 
Keep your eyes on me 
Baby, keep your eyes on me 

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now (please show me, baby) 
I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 

It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside of me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
