                        Have a holly jolly Christmas 
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know 
and everyone you meet

Oh, the mistletoe hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you, kiss her once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't here,
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas this year!
