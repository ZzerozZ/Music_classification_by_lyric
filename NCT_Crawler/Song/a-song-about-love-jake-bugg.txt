                        Bài hát: A Song About Love - Jake Bugg

You tell me all the things you do
Tell me that it's up to you
Crying in the peaceful night
Telling all the things you hide

But out there in the future
Maybe you're the rainbow
There's no song without love
With your eyes shut you cry in your bed

Is that what you wanted? Songs about love?
Is that what you hoped you would find
When it's burning inside
But a song about love's not enough
So what do you want for?
What are you needing?
Songs about memories
That hide and then shatter your mind
Like a constant reminder
I just want to find where you are
I just want to find where you are

I hold you and your eyes fall down
You barely even make a sound
Crying in the peaceful night
Showing all the things you hide

But out there in the future
Maybe you're the rainbow
There's no song without love
With your eyes shut you cry in your bed

Is that what you wanted? Songs about love?
Is that what you hoped you would find
When it's burning inside
But a song about love's not enough
So what do you want for?
What are you needing?
Songs about memories
That hide and then shatter your mind
Like a constant reminder
I just want to find where you are
I just want to find where you are

I just want to find where you are
                        
                    |
