                        An old man by a seashore
 At the end of day
 Gazes the horizon
 With seawinds in his face
 Tempest-tossed island
 Seasons all the same
 Anchorage unpainted
 And a ship without a name

 Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard
 He lightens the beacon, light at the end of world
 Showing the way lighting hope in their hearts
 The ones on their travels homeward from afar

 This is for long-forgotten
 Light at the end of the world
 Horizon crying
 The tears he left behind long ago

 The albatross is flying
 Making him daydream
 The time before he became
 One of the world's unseen
 Princess in the tower
 Children in the fields
 Life gave him it all:
 An island of the universe

 Now his love's a memory
 A ghost in the fog
 He sets the sails one last time
 Saying farewell to the world
 Anchor to the water
 Seabed far below
 Grass still in his feet
 And a smile beneath his brow

 This is for long-forgotten
 Light at the end of the world
 Horizon crying
 The tears he left behind so long ago
                        
                    |
