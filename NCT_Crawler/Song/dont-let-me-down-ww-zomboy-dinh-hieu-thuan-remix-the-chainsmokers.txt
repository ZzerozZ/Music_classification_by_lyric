                        Bài hát: Don't Let Me Down (W&W & Zomboy & Đinh Hiếu Thuận Remix) - The Chainsmokers

Crashing, hit a wall 
Right now I need a miracle 
Hurry up now, I need a miracle 
Stranded, reaching out 
I call your name but you're not around 
I say your name but you're not around 
I need you, I need you, I need you right now 
Yeah, I need you right now 
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down 
I think I'm losing my mind now 
It's in my head, darling I hope 
That you'll be here, when I need you the most 
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down 
D-Don't let me down 
Don't let me down 
Don't let me down, down, down 
Don't let me down 
Don't let me down, down, down 
R-r-running out of time 
I really thought you were on my side 
But now there's nobody by my side 
I need you, I need you, I need you right now 
Yeah, I need you right now 
So don't...
