                        Wise men say, only fools rush in.
 But I can't help falling in love with you
 Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
 I can't help falling in love with you

 As the river flows gently to the sea
 Darling so we go, some things were meant to be
 Take my hand take my whole heart too
 'Cause I can't help falling in love with you

 As the river flows gently to the sea
 Darling so we go, some things were meant to be
 Take my hand take my whole heart too
 'Cause I can't help falling in love with you
