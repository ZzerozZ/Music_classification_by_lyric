                        [Speaking softly, gradually getting louder]
 One time... Yeah... Yeah...

 Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
 One nigga front, my face on the front page
 Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
 One God to show me how to do things his son did
 Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
 Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin ***
 Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics
 Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages
 Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
 Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin us
 One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
 But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
 Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
 Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in
 Blackin out as I shoot back, *** gettin hit! [more sirens]
 This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it
 'Til everybody come home, little niggaz is grown
 Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
 Sip from the star sun and the moon
 In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
 Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin victims with doctors
 If you really think you ready to die, with nines out
 This is what nas is bout, nigga the time is now!

 [Whispering again]
 Yo, all I need is one mic...
 All I need is one mic... That's all I need
 All I need is one mic... All I need niggaz
 All I need is one mic... Yeah

 [Gradually getting louder]
 All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
 One prayer - tell God forgive for one sin
 Matter fact maybe more than one, look back
 At all the hatred against me, *** alla them
 Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots
 From twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
 Which means, one of my guns was holdin 17
 Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
 Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
 Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
 Nothin is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs
 My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air
 I let the *** slide for too many years, too many times
 Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
 If y'all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis
 Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
 There's nothin in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust
 Led flyin, feel it? I feel it in my gut
 That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
 Cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now!

 [Whispering again]
 All I need is one mic... That's all I need, that's all I need
 All I need is one mic... There's nuttin else in the world
 All I need is one mic... That's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know
 All I need is one mic...

 [Starting loud this time, getting quieter]
 All I need is one life, one try, one breath I'm one man
 What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
 Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical
 Talkin all that slick ***, the same way these bitches do
 Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you
 Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
 Too late to grab guns I'm blastin cause I'm a cool nigga
 Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggaz
 What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin
 War gets deep, some beef is everlastin
 Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other
 Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
 You know the block was I'll as a youngster
 Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
 For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggaz throwin dirt on my name
 Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
 Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
 Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
 Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes
 Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
 Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real
 Heard he was, tellin police, how can a kingpin squeal?
 This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
 You need some soul searchin, the time is now

 All I need is one mic... Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
 All I need is one mic... That's all I ever needed in this world, *** cash
 All I need is one mic... *** the cars, the jewelry
 All I need is one mic... To spread my voice to the whole world
