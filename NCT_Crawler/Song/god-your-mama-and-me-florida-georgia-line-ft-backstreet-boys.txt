                        Bài hát: God, Your Mama, And Me - Florida Georgia Line, Backstreet Boys 

That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide 
That hallelujah shoot right through ya, make you feel alive 
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at 
It's waiting with the porch light on 
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home 
Come on home, my love is 

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty 
Now until the day I die, unconditionally 
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya 
No one's ever gonna love you more than 
God, your mama, and me 
God, your mama, and me 
Unconditionally 
God, your mama, and me 

Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio 
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road 
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping 
I'll hold it, lock and key 
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave 
You better believe my love is 

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty 
Now until the day I die, unconditionally 
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya 
No one's ever gonna love you more than 
God, your mama, and me 
God, your mama, and me 
Unconditionally 
God, your mama, and me 

You better believe it, you better believe it 
Every step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow 
Every move you make, you know I'm part of you wherever you go 
Baby, you know my love is 

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty 
Now until the day I die, unconditionally 
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya 
No one's ever gonna love you more than 
God, your mama, and me 
God, your mama, and me 
Unconditionally 
God, your mama, and me
