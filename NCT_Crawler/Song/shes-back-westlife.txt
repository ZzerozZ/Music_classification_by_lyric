                        Took some time to heal
To get my heartbeat back
Just when I'm ahead
Returning from the dead
She's back again...

She knows just what to say
She always gets her way
Just when I was free
She's back inside of me
She's back again

[chorus]
So tell me why the hell I hear music
Every time she calls I hear music
Is it just the way she loves to confuse me
Oh baby
Just when I moved on
Believed that she was gone
She's back again...
She's back again

Like a predator and prey
She'll tear my heart away
She'll chew me to the bone
Leave me rotting here alone
'Til she's back again

[chorus]
So tell me why the hell I hear music
Every time she calls I hear music
Is it just the way she loves to confuse me
Oh baby
Just when I moved on
Believed that she was gone
She's back again...
She's back again
                        
                    |
