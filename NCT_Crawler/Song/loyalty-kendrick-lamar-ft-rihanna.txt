                        Bài hát: Loyalty. - Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna

[DJ Dahi:]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high up (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)

[Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna:]
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust
(All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

[Rihanna:]
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, deeper now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established
Hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright

[Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna:]
I'm a savage, I'm a ***, I'm a king
Shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, rock (yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honesty forever, all a real nigga want

[DJ Dahi:]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high up (yeah)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
(All I want is, all I want is)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Kendrick Lamar (Rihanna):]
(10-4, no switchin' sides)
Feel somethin' wrong
(You actin' shifty, you don't ride)
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Rihanna:]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to

[Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna:]
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's what God for

[DJ Dahi:]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high up

[Kendrick Lamar:]
(All I want is, all I want is)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna:]
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby
