Gathered here with my family
 ...My neighbours and my friends
 Standing firm together against oppression holding hands
 It doesn't matter where you're from
 Or if you're young, old, women or man
 We're here for the same reason; we want to take back our land

Oh God thank you
 For giving us the strength to hold on
 And now we're here together

Calling you for freedom, freedom
 We know you can hear our call ooh
 We're calling for freedom, fighting for freedom
 We know you won’t let us fall oh
 We know you're here with us

No more being prisoners in our homes
 No more being afraid to talk
 Our dream is just to be free, just to be free
 Now when we've taking our first step
 Towards a life of complete freedom
 We can see our dream getting closer and closer, we're almost there

Oh God thank you
 For giving us the strength to hold on
 And now we're here together

Calling you for freedom, freedom
 We know you can hear our call ooh
 We're calling for freedom, fighting for freedom
 We know you won’t let us fall oh
 We know you're here with us

I can feel the pride in the air
 And it makes me strong to see everyone
 Standing together holding hands in unity
 Shouting out load demanding their right for freedom
 This is it and we're not backing of
 Oh God we know you hear our call

And we're calling you for freedom, freedom
 We know you can hear our call ooh
 We're calling for freedom, calling for freedom
 We know you won’t let us fall oh
 We know you're here with us
