                        Bài hát : Ravers In The UK - Nightcore

Uptown, downtown
All around the world we gonna jump now, jump now
Everybody come because we need, more, hardcore
Mayday, mayday, ravers in the UK
[2x]

Jump, jump [3x]
Put your hands up in the air
Jump, jump [3x]

Ravers in the UK
Here comes the beat, the reggaetone move
Shake you loose while your body boom boom
Rock the lady don
Drop me baby low
Feel the bass drum shaking the room
Tell me are you ready?
You're my fantasy
Music is my energy
The rhythm is rockin' and droppin' the heat
The biggest, the bottom, the biggin', the beat

Uptown, downtown
All around the world we gonna jump now, jump now
Everybody come because we need, more, hardcore
Mayday, mayday, ravers in the UK
[2x]

Jump, jump [3x]
Put your hands up in the air

Ring the alarm let the melody speak
For all the people in every country
Up, you're taking me high girl
You're making me..
'Cause Mr. Lover Lover's bringing the heat

Mixing up the styling
Taking it back to the 90
Feels a little crazy
Give it up, we just don't care
Put your hands up in the air

Uptown, downtown
All around the world we gonna jump now, jump now
Everybody come because we need, more, hardcore
Mayday, mayday, ravers in the UK
[2x]

Jump, jump [3x]
Put your hands up in the air

Uptown, downtown
All around the world we gonna jump now, jump now
Everybody come because we need, more, hardcore
Mayday, mayday, ravers in the UK
