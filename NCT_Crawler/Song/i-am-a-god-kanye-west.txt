                        Blazin, mi don't want dem
 Mi need dem
 Blazin
 Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
 And now she find out what life is really worth
 No to X rated
 Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
 And now she find out what life is really worth
 No to X rated I am a god
 I am a god
 I am a god I am a god
 Hurry up with my damn massage
 Hurry up with my damn ménage
 Get the Porsche out the damn garage
 I am a god
 Even though I'm a man of God
 My whole life in the hands of God
 So y'all better quit playing with God Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
 Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
 The only rapper who compared to Michael
 So here's a few hating-ass niggas who'll fight you
 And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
 I don't wanna hear what some niggas might do
 Old niggas mentally still in high school
 Since the tight jeans they never liked you
 Pink-ass polos with a *** backpack
 But everybody know you brought real rap back
 Nobody else had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
 Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
 Ibn diamond, Chi-town shining
 Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate
 Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in
 Until the day I get struck by lightning I am a God
 So hurry up with my damn massage
 In a French-ass restaurant
 Hurry up with my damn croissants
 I am a God
 I am a God
 I am a God I just talked to Jesus
 He said, "What up Yeezus?"
 I said, "*** I'm chilling
 Trying to stack these millions"
 I know he the most high
 But I am a close high
 Mi casa es su casa
 That's our costra nostra
 I am a God
 I am a God
 I am a God Ain't no way I'm giving up on my god
