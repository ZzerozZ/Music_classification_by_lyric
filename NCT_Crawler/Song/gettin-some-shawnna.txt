 When u go to DTP we give the people what they want
 And when they come to hustle Joe u know we ain't no punk And you catch me in the town we blowin' dro and gettin' drunk
 And when we hit the party Joe u know we keep it crunk
 Yo nigga actin' tuff he on the flo and gettin' stomped
 Don't act like u ain't know now tell yo hoe to pass the blunt You bitches wanna be me cause u know that I'm the ***
 You see me on the TV cause I roll wit Ludacris
 Don't hate Shawnna baby just be mad at who u wit
 I keep a couple handles so u know I'm too legit Just so u understand it, so u know I'm 'bout that bread
 And don't you try to play me for no joke about my cash
 Before I get the tip I get the heat up out the stash
