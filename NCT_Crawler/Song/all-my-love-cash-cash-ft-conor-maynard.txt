                        Bài hát: All My Love - Cash Cash, Conor Maynard

Friday night, my phone is off
And none of my friends even know you're gone
All these broken picture frames
I'm sick of your face, but can't look away

Can't go out, can't stay home
I don't know how, how to be alone
I keep waiting for you, waiting for you to come back
With all of my love

How can I sleep when you're out there?
With all my love
I can't believe that you left here with all my love
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back oh woah
All my love
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back oh woah
All my love

All my love
All my love

Friday night locked in these sheets
I toss and I turn where you used to be

Can't go out, can't stay home
I don't know how, how to be alone
I keep waiting for you, waiting for you to come back
With all of my love

How can I sleep when you're out there?
With all my love
I can't believe that you left here with all my love
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back oh woah
All my love (all my love)
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back oh woah
All my love

I gotta get back, get back yeah, all my love
All my love
I gotta get back, get back yeah, all my love
