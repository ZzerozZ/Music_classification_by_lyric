                        The moon and you appear to be
 So near and yet so far from me
 And here am I on a night in June
 Reaching for the moon and you I wonder if we'll ever meet
 My song of love is incomplete
 I'm just the words looking for the tune
 Reaching for the moon and you I'm just the words looking for the tune
 Reaching for the moon and you
                        
                    |
