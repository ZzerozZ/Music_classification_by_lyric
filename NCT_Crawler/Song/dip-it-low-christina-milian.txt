                        Song: Dip It Low - Christina Milian

Says he wants you
He says he needs you
It's real talk, 
then why not make him wait for you
If he really wants you
If he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When he's a good boy
I mean a really really good boy
Why not let him lay with you
That's when you give it to him good

[Chorus:]
Dip it low
Pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out let your back roll
Pop pop pop that thing
Ima show you how to make your man say "Ooo" 
Dip it low
Pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out let your back roll
Pop pop pop that thing
Ima show you how to make your man say "Ooo" 

You getting bold
He growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love
Growin' old
You think it's time
And you're thinking of leaving
But give it time
It's late at night
He's coming home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hand
Let him know it's on
If you understand me
Yall come on

All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move 
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you want to do 
show her what you got daddy

All my ladies wind it up 
If you know just how to move 
All my fellas jump behind 
And show her what you want to do 

Dip it low
Pick it up slow (ohhh)
Roll it all around
Poke it out let your back roll
Pop pop pop that thing
Ima show you how to make your man say Ooo
ima show you how to make him
Dip it low (ouhhh)
Pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out let your back roll
Pop pop pop that thing
Ima show you how to make your man say "Ooo" 

We can move if you wanna 
We can move if you wanna 
We can mooove if you wanna 
We can mooooooove...

Dip it low
Pick it up slow (slowww)
Roll it all around (ohhhh)
Poke it out let your back roll 
Pop pop pop that thing (yeah)
Ima show you how to make your man say "Ooo" 
Dip it low
Pick it up slow 
Roll it all around
Poke it out let your back roll (come on come on come on)
Pop pop pop that thing
Ima show you how to make your man say "Ooo" (ooooh)

Dip it low
Pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out let your back roll
Pop pop pop that thing
Ima show you how to make your man say "Ooo" 
Dip it low
Pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out let your back roll
Pop pop pop that thing
Ima show you how to make your man say "Ooo"
