                        Every night I have the same old dream
 'bout you and me and what's in between
 So many changes, so many lies
 Try to run, try to hide
 From everything that I feel inside
 But I can't escape you or your frozen eyes...
 Searching in the darkness
 Fading out of sight
 Love was here and gone like a thief in the night...
 Stone Cold...
 and I thought I knew you so well
 Stone Cold
 Can't break away from your spell
 Another dark and empty night
 If I was wrong I wanna make it right
 But you are so distant, so far away
 Your words like ice fall on the ground
 Breaking the silence without a sound
 Oh familiar strangers with nothing to say
 Searching in the darkness
 Fading out of sight
 Love was here and gone like a thief in the night...
 Stone Cold...
 and I thought I knew you so well...
 Stone Cold
 Can't break away from your spell...
 You leave me Stone Cold
 Searching in the darkness
 Fading out of sight
 Love was here and gone like a thief in the night...
 Stone Cold...
 and I thought I knew you so well
 Stone Cold
 Can't break away from your spell
 You're Stone Cold...yeah
 I can't break away from your spell
 Stone Cold...baby
 I thought I knew you so well
 You're stone cold...ice cold
 Can't break away from your spell
 (you put me in the deep freeze)
 (oh baby don't you leave me)
 (stone...cold, your leavin' me cold)
 Stone Cold...I thought I knew you so well
 Stone Cold...Can't break away from your spell
 repeat til fade
