                        Bài hát: Queen Of My Heart (Live At Croke Park) - Westlife

So here we stand in our secret place
Where the sound of the crowd is so far away
You take my hand, and it feels like home
We both understand, it's where we belong

So how do I say, do I say goodbye?
We both have our dreams, we both wanna fly
So let's take tonight, to carry us through
The lonely times

I'll always look back as I walk away
This memory will last for eternity
And all of our tears will be lost in the rain
When I find my way back to your arms again
But until that day you know you are
The queen of my heart, the queen of my heart

So let's take tonight and never let go
While dancing we'll kiss, like there's no tomorrow
As the stars sparkle down, like a diamond ring
I'll treasure this moment till we meet again

But no matter how far
(No matter how far)
Or where you may be
(Where you may be)
I just close my eyes
(Just close my eyes)
And you're in my dreams
And there you will be until we meet

I'll always look back as I walk away
This memory will last for eternity
And all off our tears will be lost in the rain
When I find my way back to your arms again
But until that day you know you are
The queen of my heart

I'll always look back as I walk away
This memory will last for eternity
And all off our tears will be lost in the rain
When I find my way back to your arms again
But until that day you know you are
The queen of my heart

Oh yeah
You're the queen of my heart
(Queen of my heart)
No matter how many years it takes
(Queen of my heart)
I'll do it all to you, oh yeah
(Queen of my heart)
Oh yes you are
The queen of my heart
                        
                    |
