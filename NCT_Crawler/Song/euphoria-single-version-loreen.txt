                        Why, why can’t this moment last forevermore?
Tonight, tonight eternity’s an open door
No, don’t ever stop doing the things you do
Don’t go, in every breath I take I’m breathing you

Euphoria, forever till the end of time
From now on, only you and I, we’re going u-u-u-u-u-up
Euphoria, an everlasting piece of art
A beating love within my heart, we’re going u-u-u-u-u-up

We are here, we’re all alone in our own universe
We are free, where everything’s allowed and love comes first
Forever and ever together, we sail into infinity
We’re higher and higher and higher, we’re reaching for divinity

Euphoria, forever ’till the end of time
From now on, only you and I, we’re going u-u-u-u-u-up
Euphoria, an everlasting piece of art
A beating love within my heart, we’re going u-u-u-u-u-up

Forever we sail into infinity
We’re higher, we’re reaching for divinity

Euphoria, euphoria
We’re going u-u-u-u-u-up
Euphoria, an everlasting piece of art
A beating love within my heart, we’re going u-u-u-u-u-up
Euphoria, euphoria
We’re going u-u-u-u-u-up
