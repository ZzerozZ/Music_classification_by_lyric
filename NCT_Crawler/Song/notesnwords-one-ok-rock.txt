                        Bài hát: Notes'n'Words - One Ok Rock

I wanna dance like no one’s watching me
I wanna love like it’s the only thing I know
I wanna laugh from the bottom of my heart
I wanna sing like every single note and word it’s all for you

Is this enough?

I wanna tell you and this is the only way I know
And hope one day you’ll learn the words and say
That you finally see, what I see

Another song for you about your love
’cause you love the me that’s full of faults
I wish you could see it from this view
’cause everything around you is a little bit brighter from your love

I wanna dance the night away with you
I wanna love because you taught me to
I wanna laugh all your tears away
I wanna sing ’cause every single note and word it’s just for you

Hope it’s enough?

I wanna tell you and this is the only way I know
And hope one day you’ll learn the words and say
That you finally see, how I feel

Another song for you about your love
’cause you love the me that’s full of faults
I wish you could see it from this view
’cause everything around you is a little bit brighter from your love

Not a day goes by that I don’t think
About you and the love you’ve given me
I wish you could see it from this view
’cause everything around you is a little bit brighter from your love
Life is just so much better from your love
                        
                    |
