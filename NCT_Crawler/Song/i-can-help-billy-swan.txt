                        BÀI hát : I Can Help - Billy Swan

If you've got a problem, don't care what it is
 If you need a hand, I can assure you this I can help, I've got two strong arms, I can help
 It would sure do me good to do you good
 Let me help It's a fact that people get lonely, ain't nothing new
 But a woman like you, babe, should never have the blues Let me help, I've got two for me, let me help
 It would sure do me good to do you good
 Let me help When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dreams
 Holding me tight and telling me everything I want to hear Don't forget me, babe, all you gotta do is call
 You know how I feel about you, I can do anything at all Let me help if your child needs a Dad, I can help
 It would sure do me good to do you good
 Let me help When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dreams
 Holding me tight and telling me everything I want to hear Don't forget me, babe, all you gotta do is call
 You know how I feel about you, if I can do anything at all Let me help, for a child needs a Dad, I can help
 It would sure do me good to do you good
 Let me help
