                        This ain't go be easy

 Uh
 You got it, you got it
 Put it in

 [Verse 1]
 Tables turned into a situation
 Now you standing in my face and you been patiently waiting
 Fumbling over words, forget the conversation
 Thinking maybe we could make the combination
 Wanna see me lose my breathe, wanna hear me moan
 Better be ready, will and able when we get along
 You was talking tough up on in the telephone
 So you better put it in when we get it on

 No turning back from this party
 Put you through enough to come play (hey)
 And ain't no coming down from this high
 My love don't go nowhere less I say

 Look at what you got yourself into
 Best take advantage, be all that you can be
 Best take advantage, see all that you can see
 Cause this could be a less opportunity that won't be

 [Chorus]
 Put it in
 Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
 Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (put it in)
 Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
 Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (go hard)
 Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
 Do it baby, do-do it baby get it
 Don't come around, keep on lettin me down
 You gotta get it all the way in, I wanna see you work

 [Verse 2]
 Now you looking like you looking for an explanation
 Is the curves on my body for you motivation
 Skip the petty needs, No time for complication
 Use both hands to make sure I reach my destination
 Better leave a good impression fore you hit the door
 Cause you don't want me talking bout your business on the low
 You show it off, I had to fit you in my schedule
 So you better put it on me when it's time to go

 No turning back from this party
 Put you through enough to come play (hey)
 And ain't no coming down from this high
 My love don't go nowhere less I say

 Look at what you got yourself into
 Best take advantage, be all that you can be
 Best take advantage, see all that you can see
 Cause this could be a less opportunity that won't be

 [Chorus]
 Put it in
 Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
 Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (put it in)
 Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
 Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (go hard)
 Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
 Do it baby, do-do it baby get it
 Don't come around, keep on lettin me down
 You gotta get it all the way in, I wanna see you work

 [Bridge]
 I ain't excepting no excuses baby (no)
 Don't brag about it if you useless baby (no)
 You better blow me away, make a girl wanna stay
 At your spot for another round
 It's your chance to prove, Don't forget your moves
 There's nothing to lose, but me

 [Chorus (x2)]
                        
                    |
