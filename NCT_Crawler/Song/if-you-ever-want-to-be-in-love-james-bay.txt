                        Bài hát: If You Ever Want To Be In Love - James Bay 

Saw you today after so much time 
Felt just like it used to be 
Talking for hours bout a different life 
Surrounding us in memories 
We were close never close enough 
Baby are we now 
'Cause if it's torn we can stitch it up 
Don't rule it out 
Oh no no 

I'll come around 
If you ever want to be in love 
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up 
If you ever want to be in love 
I'll come around 

Wanted to ask if we could have been 
But my tongue wouldn't break the seal 
You always had something effortless 
At school you were the biggest deal 
Little quirks close and open up 
Time is slipping by 
Always thinking 'bout the two of us 
Replay on my mind 
Always playing on my mind 

I'll come around 
If you ever want to be in love 
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up 
If you ever want to be in love 
I'll come around 

We were young we were side by side 
Don't know when we started losing touch 
If you want we could walk around 
Maybe that would be enough 
Used to talk drinking to the night 
I would wake up on the front room floor 
All along you'd be in my bed 
Make me crazy make me want you more 

I'll come around 
If you ever want to be in love 
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up 
I'll come around 
If you ever want to be in love 
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up 
If you ever want to be in love 
I'll come around
                        
                    |
