                        The last train is nearly due
 The underground is closing soon
 In the dark deserted station
 Restless in anticipation
 A man waits in the shadows.

 His restless eyes leap and scratch
 At all that they can touch or catch
 Hidden deep within his pocket
 Safe within his silent socket
 He holds his colored crayon.

 Now from the tunnel's stony womb
 The carriage rides to meet the groom
 And opens wide and welcome doors
 But he hesitates then withdraws
 Deeper in the shadows

 And the train is gone suddenly
 On wheels clicking silently
 Like a gently tapping litany
 And he holds his crayon rosary
 Tighter in his hand

 Now from his pocket he quickly flashes
 The crayon on the wall he slashes
 Deep upon the advertising
 A single-worded poem comprised of
 - four letters

 And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
 The poem across the tracks rebounding
 Shadowed by the exit light
 His legs take their ascending flight
 To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night.
                        
                    |
