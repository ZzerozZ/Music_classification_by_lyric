                        Bài hát: The Bright Side - Lenka

I've got a glass half full and I'm making a toast to you
I've got a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow too
ooh, this is heaven on the lollipop stick
ooh, life is suddenly sweet

'Cause I'm living on the bright side
And I wanna stay here, is that okay?
Can't believe that this is my life
I was just looking but I started living on the bright side
Oh, wa, oh on the bright side [x3]

I got a real dark cloud with a silver lining now
But the grass is greener wherever I lay me down
Ooh, this is heaven on the lollipop stick
Ooh, is this how happiness feels?

When we're living on the bright side
And we wanna stay here, is that okay?
Can't believe that this is our life
We were just looking, but we started living on the bright side
Oh, wa, oh on the bright side [x3]

Oh it's a hop, skip and a jump to a heart full of love
Oh, even if you're the type to be down in the dumps and gloomy
Take a new look and take it from me
There's room over here on the bright side
Oh, wa, oh on the bright side [x3]

'Cause I'm living on the bright side
And I wanna stay here, is that okay?
Can't believe that this is my life
I was just looking but I started living, living on the bright side
And I wanna stay here, is that okay?
Can't believe that this is my life
I was just looking but I started living on the bright side

Oh, wa, oh on the bright side [x3]
