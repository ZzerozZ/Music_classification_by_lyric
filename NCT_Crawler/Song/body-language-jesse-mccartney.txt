                        Ooo, that body's like music to my ear
Ooo, that body's like music to my ear
Ooo, that body's like music to my ear
'Cause what you want is right here

Oh she, oh she so international
The way, the way she get it on the floor
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to holler at you
I want to get to know you better

Parlez vous francais?
Konichiwa
Come and move in my way
Hey, little chica from Guadeloupe
That thing you got behind you is amazing

Now, I don't speak Spanish, Japanese or French
But the way that body's talkin' definitely makes sense
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
The way she moves around
When she grinds to the beat
Breaking it down articulately
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
It's her, her body, her body, her body

That make me want to say hey...('ey!)
Hey...('ey!)
Hey...('ey!)
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
C'mon

Shorty, let me whisper in your ear
Tell you everything you wanna hear
You got my vote: Hottest Girl of the Year
Let's have a celebration, baby

I'm lifting up my voice
