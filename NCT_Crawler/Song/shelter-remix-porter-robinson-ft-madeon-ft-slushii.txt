                        Bài hát: Shelter Remix - Porter Robinson, Madeon, Slushii

I could never find the right way to tell you
Have you noticed I've been gone?
(Be)'cause I left behind the home that you made me
But I will carry it along

And it's a long way forward, so trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone

When I'm older, I'll be silent beside you
I know words won't be enough
And they won't need to know the names or our faces
But they will carry on for us

And it's a long way forward, so trust in me
I'll give them shelter like you've done for me
And I know I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone

Oh, it's a long way forward, trust in me
I'll give them shelter like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until...
