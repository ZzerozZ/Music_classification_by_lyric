                        You did not dare say a single word
 I did not dare ask for something more
 I've kept my questions secret deep inside
 But I wish, I could have let you know about
 A time when I would have said Wait and please stay
 Did you mean to push me away?
 Please, wait and just stay
 Did you want it to be this way? Would you want to know what I've been through?
 (Through all this time, all this time)
 Would you want to know I have missed you too?
 (And I have you on my mind)
 And you've been and you will be a part of me
 (That I can't find)
 And you've been forgiven for your silence
 All this time when I would have said Wait and please stay
 Did you mean to push me away?
 Please, wait and just say
 Is there a way that could replace The times you never said
 How've you been?
 Do you need anything?
 Want you to know I'm here
 Want you to feel me near Yeah and I hope
 I hope that you will find your way
 Yeah and I hope
 I hope there will be better days Please wait and just stay
 (Please stay)
 Did you mean to push me away?
 Please wait and just stay
 (Wait, just stay)
 Did you want it to be this way? Wait, please say
 (Yeah and I hope)
 I hope that you will find your way
 Please, wait and just stay
 (Wait and I hope)
 I hope there will be better days Hey, hey, wait
 Please stay
 Just stay
 Please wait
