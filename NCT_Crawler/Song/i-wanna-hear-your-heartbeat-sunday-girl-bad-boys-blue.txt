                        Half awake and half in dreams
 On a Sunday
 Sunay night.
 Walking all alone in the streets
 On a Sunday
 Sunday night.
 But then an angel passed me by

 A little angel made me sigh.
 Just when I wanted you

 A dream came true - called love.

 I wanna hear your heartbeat

 Wanna feel what you need.
 Let me stay tonight by your side

 By your side.
 I wanna hear your heartbeat

 Share your dreams when you're asleep

 Let me hold you tight
 In the night
 In the night.

 I don't wanna waste one second
 Without your loving

 Without you
 Sunday girl.
 You only gotta reach out

 Reach out and taste my loving.
 Want you so
 Sunday girl

 Oh
 I really want you

 Sunday Girl.

 Heaven sent you down to me
 On a Sunday
 Sunday night.
 To rescue me from mistery
 On a Sunday
 Sunday night.
 You made me leave the past behind

 I've got you always on my mind

 Just when I wanted you

 A dream came true - called love.

 I wanna hear your heartbeat...

 I wanna hear your heartbeat...
                        
                    |
