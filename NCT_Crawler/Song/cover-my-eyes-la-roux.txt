                        No wonder I'm scared to look in your eyes
 You've turned me away so many times
 You can take it away at any given moment
 It's hard to believe while you're in this disguise So would you hold me please?
 I'm trying hard to breath
 I'm just surviving
 So would you hold me please?
 I'm trying hard to breath
 Stop me from crying When I see you walking with her
 I have to cover my eyes
 (I have to cover my eyes)
 Every time you leave with her
 Something inside of me dies
 (Something inside of me dies) No wonder it hurts to sit by your side
 (Turned me away so many times)
 There's a different song I can play you tonight
 (We don't have to sit here in silence)
 We can break the pattern, we can change the color
 (It's just a little sacrifice)
 You don't need to worry about the others
 (It's all in your mind) So would you hold me please?
 I'm trying hard to breath
 I'm just surviving
 So would you hold me please?
 I'm trying hard to breath
 Stop me from crying
 When I see you walking with her
 I have to cover my eyes
 (I have to cover my eyes)
 Every time you leave with her
 Something inside of me dies
 (Something inside of me dies) [repeat 2x]
 Something inside of me dies When I see you walking with her
 I have to cover my eyes
 (cover my eyes, cover my eyes, cover my eyes)
 Every time you leave with her
 Something inside of me dies
 (Something inside of me dies) x3
