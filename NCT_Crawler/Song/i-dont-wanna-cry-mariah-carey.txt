                        Title: I Don'T Wanna Cry
Artist: Mariah Carey
Once again we sit in silence
...
After all is said and done
...
Only emptiness inside us
...
Baby, look what we've become
...
We can make a million promises
...
But we still won't change
...
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring 
Each other pain
...
I don't wanna cry
...
Don't wanna cry
...
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
...
To where we used to be
...
Though I've given you 
My heart and soul
...
(given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby,
...
I don't wanna cry
...
I don't wanna cry
...
Too far apart to bridge the distance
...
But something keeps us 
Hanging on and on
...
Pretending not to know 
The difference
...
Denying what we had is gone
...
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
...
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around
...
I don't wanna cry
...
Don't wanna cry
...
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
...
To where we used to be
...
Though I've given you 
My heart and soul
...
(given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby,
...
I don't wanna cry
...
I don't wanna cry
...
All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
on make-believing
...
'Cause I don't wanna cry
...
Don't wanna cry
...
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
...
Though I've given you 
My heart and soul
(given you my heart and soul)
I've given you my heart and soul
...
I must find a way of letting go
...
'Cause baby,
...
I don't wanna cry
...
I don't wanna cry
...
I don't wanna cry
...
