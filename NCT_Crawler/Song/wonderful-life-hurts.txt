                        On a bridge across the Severn on a Saturday night
 Susie meets the man of her dreams
 He says that he got in trouble and if she doesn't mind
 He doesn't want the company But there's something in the air, they share a look in silence
 And everything is understood
 Susie grabs her man and puts a grip on his hand
 As the rain puts a tear in his eye She says, "Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
 Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life" Driving through the city to the Temple Station
 Cries into the leather seat
 And Susie knows the baby was a family man
 But the world has got him down on his knees So she throws him at the wall and kisses burn like fire
 And suddenly he starts to believe
 He takes her in his arms and he doesn't know why
 But he thinks that he begins to see She says, "Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
 Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life" Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
 Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life She says, "Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
 Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life" Don't let go
 Don't let go
 Don't let go
 Don't let go Don't let go
 Don't let go
 Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
 Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life She says, "Don't let go
 Never give up
 Don't let go
 Never give up, it's such a wonderful life Don't let go
 Wonderful life, wonderful, wonderful life
 Don't let go
 Wonderful life, wonderful, wonderful life Don't let go
 Don't let go
