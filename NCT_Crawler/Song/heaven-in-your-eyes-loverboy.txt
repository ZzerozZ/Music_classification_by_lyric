                        I can tell by the look in your eyes
You've been hurting
You know I'll never let you down 
And I'll try anything to keep it working
You gave me time to find out
What my heart was looking for
And what I'm feeling inside

In your eyes
I want to see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feeling to end
It took some time to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the heaven in your eyes

Can't you see I'm finding it hard to let go 
All the heartaches weve been through
I never really thought I'd see this love grow
But you helped me see
Now I know what my hearts been looking for
And what I'm feeling inside

In your eyes
I want to see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feeling to end
It took some time to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the heaven in your eyes

We've been living on the edge
Where only the strong survive
We've been living on the edge
And it's something that we just can't hide
Oh this feeling inside

In your eyes
I want to see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feeling to end
It took some time to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the heaven in your eyes
Oh yeah, I can see the heaven in your eyes
Oh yeah, I can see the heaven in your eyes
I can see the heaven in your eyes
Heaven in your eyes oh
Heaven in your eyes
I can see the heaven, heaven in your eyes
Heaven in your eyes
                        
                    |
