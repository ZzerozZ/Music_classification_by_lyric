                        I think I did it again 
I made you believe we're more than just friends 
Oh baby, it might seem like a crush 
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious 

'Cause to lose all my senses 
That is just so typically me 
Oh baby, baby 

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

You see my problem is this 
I'm dreaming away 
Wishing that heroes they truly exist 
I cry, watching the days 
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways 

Oops!... I did it again 
I played with your heart, 
Got lost in the game, oh baby, baby 
Oops!... you think I'm in love 
That I'm sent from above 
I'm not that innocent 

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah x4 

Oops!... I 
Did it again to your heart 
Got lost in this game, oh baby 
Oops!... you 
Think that I'm sent from above 
I'm not that innocent 

Oops!... I did it again 
I played with your heart, 
Got lost in the game, oh baby, baby 
Oops!... you think I'm in love 
That I'm sent from above 
I'm not (Not) 
That (That) 
Innocent 

Oop s!... I (Oops I) did it again (Did it again) 
I played with your heart, 
Got lost in the game, oh baby, baby 
Oops!... you (Oops!... you) think I'm in love 
That I'm sent from above 
I'm not that innocent
