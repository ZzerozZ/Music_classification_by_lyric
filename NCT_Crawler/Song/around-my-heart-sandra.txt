                        Bài hát: Around My Heart - Sandra

Some time back in 85
In July
When the summer was high
And we've been alright
You know what money can't buy

One kiss on a flatbed truck
A hot rain
Has completed our luck
You said
Words don't mean nothing
But you will be mine

It goes around my heart
Hey hey what a criminal man
Life will go in circles
All around my heart
Hey hey
It's such a dangerous game
I'm afraid
You'd lose your trust in love

Good friend
In the darkest night
You feel blind
But my love is cateyed
Just follow its light
You've got to follow the light

Some day you'll be face to face
And you'll see
Human nature can't waste
My love
Words don't mean nothing
As long as you're mine

It goes around my heart
Hey hey what a criminal man
Life will go in circles
All around my heart
Hey hey
It's such a dangerous game
I'm afraid
You'd lose your trust in love
                        
                    |
