                        Bài hát: Just Around The Corner - Cock Robin

Things aren't quite as they seem 
Inside my domain 
You can't know about everything 
Only pleasure and pain 

You wonder why I come here 
With head to my hands 
Where else can I be cured 
And the king of your mansion 

A thorn in your side 
A child to protect 
That claims he's free 

Just around the corner 
Half a mile to heaven 
Strong enough to hold you 
Starved for some affection 
Darling, come quickly 
Come ease my mind 
For my prayers have not been answered in a long time 

I've already made my bed 
Like it or not 
As long as there's no regrets 
I'll be here when the ride stops 

These comforts to me 
And these crosses to bear 
With which we live 

Just around the corner 
Half a mile to heaven 
Strong enough to hold you 
Starved for some affection 
Baby, I can't drag you into this mess 

I'm the thorn in your side 
And the child to protect 

And I'm just around the comer 
Half a mile to heaven, oh 
Oh, Strong enough to hold you 
Starved for some affection 
Darling, come quickly 
Come ease my worried mind 
For my prayers have not been answered in a long time 

Some just around the corner, jeh 
Some strong enough to hold you 
Half a mile to heaven, jeh 
Just around the corner ...
                        
                    |
