                        Fussin' and fightin', we back at it again
 I know that it's my fault, but you don't understand (no)
 I got memories, this is crazy
 You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
 Good with ma, good with pa, cool with all my niggas
 I should try to decide, wanna let you in, but no
 That means memories, and it's crazy
 You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know Girl, I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
 And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
 I said I really wanna work this out
 Damn, girl, I'm tryin'
 It's no excuse, no excuse
 But I got this [Chorus: x2]
 I got this icebox where my heart used to be (but I got this)
 I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
 I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
 I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold Why can't I get it right?
 Just can't let it go
 I opened up, she let me down
 I won't feel that no more
 I got memories, this is crazy
 She ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
 I don't mean to take it out on you, baby, but I can't help it
 'Cause my heart is in the same ol' condition that baby left it
 And I, I apologize for makin' you cry
 Look me in my eye, and promise you won't do me the same Girl, I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
 And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
 I said I really wanna work this out
 Damn, girl, I'm tryin'
 It's no excuse, no excuse
 But I got this [Chorus: x2] I don't wanna be stuck up in this cold, cold world
 Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl
 Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl
 Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl
 I don't wanna be stuck up in this cold, cold world
 Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl
 Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl
 Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl Girl, I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
 And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
 I said I really wanna work this out
 Damn, girl, I'm tryin'
 It's no excuse, no excuse
 But I got this [Chorus: x2] Girl, I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
