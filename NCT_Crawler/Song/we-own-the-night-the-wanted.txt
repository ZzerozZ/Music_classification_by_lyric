                        Bài hát: We Own The Night - The Wanted

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance 'til we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

La la la la la
La la la la la

When my time is over, lying in my grave
Written on my tombstone, I want it to say,
"This man was a legend, a legend of his time.
When he was at a party, the party never died."

Hey, everybody's got a dream so what do you say
Are we making history?

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance 'til we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

La la la la la
La la la la la

For tonight I'm famous, for tonight I'm king
And I will be remembered for centuries. They'll say,
"This man was a hero, a hero of the night.
When he was at a party, the party never died."

Hey, I'm a little drunk but I got something to say

(Hold your jars!)

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance 'til we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night

And let us wake up inside of stranger's bed
Let us drink until there is nothing left
And this night, my friends, we will not forget
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance 'til we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night
                        
                    |
