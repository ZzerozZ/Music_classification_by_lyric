                        I look at you, then you me
Hungry and thirsty are we
Holding the lion's share
Holding the key
Holding me back cause I'm striving to be...

Better than you (Better than you)
Better than you (Better than you)

Lock horns I push and I strive
Somehow I feel more alive
Bury the need for it
Bury the seed
Bury me deep where there's no will to be

Better than you (Better than you) ho,
Better than you (Better than you)

Oh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, no, nothing brings me down
No, I couldn't stop this train from rolling on and on on
No, no, forever holding on...

Oh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, yo, you can't take it down
No, never stop this locomotion, on and on and on and on
No, you can't bring it down cause I'm

Better than you (Better than you)
Better than you (Better than you)
Oh better than you (Better than you)
Better than you (Better than you)
Much Better than you

Better than you (Better than you)
Oh better than you (Better than you)
Better than you (Better than you)
Better than
Better than
Better than
Better than you, yeah

Can't stop this train from rolling

Forever on and on and on and on and on
Forever on and on and on

Better than you, yeah
Better than you
