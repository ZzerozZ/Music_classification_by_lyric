                        Bài hát: Howl At The Moon - Cheryl Wheeler

If I were maybe a wolf or a dog
I wouldn't have to speak
Wouldn't have to talk
Just eat my dinner and go for a walk
And howl at the moon

And if I were laying there just like you
All curled up the way dogs do
I'd dream that dream that you're dreamin' too
And howl at the moon

Howl at the moon
Howl at the moon

And if I could carry your black and white
Sleep so sound wake so nice
I'd keep real close to my own advice
And howl at the moon

Oh, you know something I don't know
You go places I can't go
You lift your head when the breezes blow
To voices older than time

I'll keep you close
Oh, I like you near
I'll touch your head and pull your ear
And watch you resting while I sit here
And howl at the moon

Howl at the moon
Howl at the moon
Howl at the moon

I'll watch you resting while I sit here
And howl at the moon
                        
                    |
