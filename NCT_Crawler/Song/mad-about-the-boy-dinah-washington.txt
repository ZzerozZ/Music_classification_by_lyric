                        I'm mad about the boy
 I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
 I'm so ashamed of it but must admit the sleepless nights I've had
 About the boy

 On the silverscreen
 He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
 Although I'm quite aware that here and there are traces of the cad
 About the boy

 Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
 I really shouldn't care
 Lord knows I'm not a school girl
 In the flury of her first affair

 Will it ever cloy
 This odd diversity of misery and joy
 I'm feeling quite insane and young again
 And all because I'm mad about the boy

 So if I could employ
 A little magic that will finally destroy
 This dream that pains me and enchains me
 But I can't because I'm mad... 
 I'm mad about the boy
                        
                    |
