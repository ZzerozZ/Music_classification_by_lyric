                        Bài hát: Words As Weapons - Seether

All I really want is something beautiful to say

Keep me locked up in your broken mind
I keep searching, never been able
To find a light behind your dead eyes
Not anything at all

You keep living in your own lie
Ever deceitful and ever unfaithful
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified
Take everything from my world

Say, "Can you help me?" right before the fall
Take what you can and leave me to the wolves

Keep me dumb, keep me paralyzed
Why try swimming? I'm drowning in fable
You're not that saint that you externalize
You're not anything at all

(All I really want is something beautiful to say)

It's all so playful when you demonize
To spit out the hateful, you're willing and able
Your words are weapons of the terrified
You're nothing in my world

Say, "Can you help me?" right before the fall
Take what you can and leave me to the wolves

All I really want is something beautiful to say
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified
All I really want is something beautiful to say
You keep living in your own lie

All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away
I wanna live forever

All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away
I wanna live forever

You keep living in your own lie
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified

All I really want is something beautiful to say

Say, "Can you help me?" right before the fall?
Take what you can and leave me to the wolves

All I really want is something beautiful to say
Words are weapons of the terrified
All I really want is something beautiful to say
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified

All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away
I wanna live forever

All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away
I wanna live forever
                        
                    |
