                        Standing in line marking time
 Waiting for the welfare dime
 'Cause they can't buy a job
 The man in the silk suit hurries by
 As he catches the poor ladies' eyes
 Just for fun he says, "Get a job" That's just the way it is
 Some things will never change
 That's just the way it is
 Ah but don't you believe them Said, hey little boy you can't go where the others go
 'Cause you don't look like they do
 Said, hey old man how can you stand
 To think that way, did you really think about it
 Before you made the rules? He said, "Son, that's just the way it is
 Some things will never change
 That's just the way it is
 Ah but don't you believe them" That's just the way it is
 That's just the way it is Well they passed a law in '64
 To give those who ain't got a little more
 But it only goes so far
 Because the law don't change another's mind
 When all it sees at the hiring time
 Is the line on the color bar, no, no, no That's just the way it is
 Some things will never change
 That's just the way it is
 That's just the way it is, it is, it is, it is
