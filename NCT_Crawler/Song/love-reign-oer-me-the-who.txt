                        Only love,
Can make it rain,
The way the beach is kissed by the sea.
Only love,
Can make it rain,
Like the sweat of lovers laying in the fields.

Love, Reign o'er me.
Love, Reign o'er me, Reign o'er me, Reign o'er me.


Only love,
Can bring the rain,
That makes you yearn to the sky.
Only love,
Can bring the rain,
That falls like tears from on high.

Love, Reign o'er me.
Love, Reign o'er me, o'er me.


On the dry and dusty road,
The nights we spend apart alone.
I need to get back home to cool, cool rain.
I can't sleep and I lay and I think,
The night is hot and black as ink.
Oh God, I need a drink of cool, cool rain.

(Guitar Solo)

Love, Reign o'er me, over me ,over me ..(scream )
Love, Reign o'er me, Reign o'er me, Reign o'er me.
(pause )

LOVE !!!!
