                        Bài hát: Beautiful In White (DJ Deepwell Remix) - Shane Filan

Not sure if you know this
but when we first met
I got so nervous
I couldn’t speak
In that very moment
I found the one
and my life had found its missing piece

So as long as I live I’ll love you,
will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now till my very last breath
This day I’ll cherish
You look so beautiful in white tonight

What we have is timeless
My love is endless

and with this ring I say to the world
You’re my every reason
You’re all that I believe in
With all my heart I mean every word

So as long as I live I’ll love you,
will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now till my very last breath
This day I’ll cherish
You look so beautiful in white tonight

ohh ohh
You look so beautiful in white tonight
na na na na
so beautiful in white tonight

And if a daughter is what our future holds
I hope she has your eyes

finds love like you and I did
and when she falls in love we’ll let her go
and I’ll walk her down the aisle
She’ll look so beautiful in white

You look so beautiful in white

So as long as I live I’ll love you,
will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now till my very last breath

This day I’ll cherish
You look so beautiful in white tonight
                        
                    |
