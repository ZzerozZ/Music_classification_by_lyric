                        Okay
 I am going to attempt to drown myself
 You can try this at home
 You can be just like me Mic check 1, 2
 We recording?
 I'm cancerous
 So when I dis you, you wouldn't want to answer this
 If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
 I strangled you to death and I choked you again
 And break your ***in' legs till your bones poke through your skin
 You beef wit' me, I'm even the score equally
 Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat your ass legally
 I get too blunted off the funny home grown
 'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
 So if I said I never did drugs
 That would mean i lie and get *** more than the President does
 Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
 I ripped her ***in' tonsils out and fed her sherbet
 My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
 Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
 Every girl I ever went out with has gone les '
 Follow me and do exactly what the song says
 Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people
 And drink and jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
 I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
 So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date wit' Lauryn Hill
 Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill
 'Cause I stand out like a green hat wit a orange bill
 But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
 How the *** can I be white, I don't even exist
 I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
 Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
 My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave
 And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave Now follow me and do exactly what you see
 Don't you want to grow up to be just like me
 I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
 Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
 When we heard a knock at the door, must of been Ron Gold
 Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
 Killed 'em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco
 My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
 I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
 I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
 That'll spray an Aerosol can up in the ozone layer
 My rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue
 Wit' your dead grandmother's corpse then throw it on your porch
 Jumped into a chicken hawk cartoon with a cape on
 And beat Fog Horn Leghorn with an acorn
 I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, wit' deformative traits
 A premature birth that was four minutes late
 Mother are you there, I love you
 I never meant to hit you over the head wit that shovel
 Will someone explain to my brain
 That I just severed a main vein
 With a chainsaw and I'm in pain
 I take a breather and sigh
 Either I'm high, or I'm nuts
 'Cause if you ain't even in this room neither am I
 So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
 Then It's probably obvious that I got it on with her
 'Cause when I drop it off with this solo *** it's over with
 I bought cages tape opened it and dubbed over it I came to the club drunk with a fake I-D
 Don't you want to grow up to be just like me
 I've been with ten women who got H-I-V
 Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me
 I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
 Don't you want to grow up to be just like me
 I tied a rope around my penis then I jumped from a tree
 You probably want to grow up and be just like me
