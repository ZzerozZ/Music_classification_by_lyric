                        Smile, an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost it's glory
Lets start a brand new story
Now, my love
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say...

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away

Talk, in everlasting words
And dedicate them all, to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
a single word I say...

CHORUS, repeat

Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da

This world has lost it's glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now, my love
You think that I don't even mean
a single word I say...
                        
                    |
