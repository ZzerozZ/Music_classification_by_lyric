                        Bài hát: Beauty And The Beast - Emma Thompson

Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise, woah

Ever just the same, oh
And ever a surprise, yeah
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh-oh-ooh

Tale as old as time, a-a-ay
Tune as old as song, oh
Bitter-sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong, woah

Certain as the sun
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Woah a-a-ay
Beauty and
Beauty and the Beast
