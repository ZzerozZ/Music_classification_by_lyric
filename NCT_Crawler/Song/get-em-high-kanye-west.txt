R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        I'm trying to catch the beat, uh
 I'm trying to catch the beat
 I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh
 I'm trying to catch the beat Now, thr-thr-throw your mother***ing hands (Get 'em high!)
 All the girls pass the weed to your mother***ing man (Get 'em high!)
 Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
 And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!) N-n-n-now, my flow
 Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydrolics
 I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
 My freshman year I was going through hell, a problems
 Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college
 My teacher said I's a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
 I give a *** if you feel me, I'm gonna follow
 My heart, and if you follow the charts, or to the plaques or the stacks
 You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
 I'm so shy that you thought it was bashful but this
 ***'s flow will bash a skull and I will
 Cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
 And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
 And I won't, give you that money that you asking fo'
 Why you think, me and Dame cool, we assholes
 That's why we here your music in fast fo'
 Cause we don't want to here that weak *** no mo' Now, thr-thr-throw your mother***ing hands (Get 'em high!)
 All the girls pass the weed to your mother***ing man (Get 'em high!)
 Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
 And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!) Now now now now now who the hell is this
 E-mailing me at 11:26, tellin' me that she 36-26,
 Plus double D you know how girls on black planet be when they get bubble E
 At NYU but she hail from Kansas,
 Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
 Sent me a picture with a feeling on Candice
 Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
 W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet
 So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
 His name Kweli (You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib)
 I mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
 I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lying)
 Yo Kwe', she don't believe me, please pickup the line
 She goin' think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
 Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes but
 Get 'em high, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out
 And my rhymes as fitting to blow you trying to blow backs out
 Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, hey yo
 Ain't you meet that chick that got friends with yo moms
 And she's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
 Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
 Anyways, I don't usually *** with the internet
 Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
 You really ***ing that much, you trying to get off cigarettes
 And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
 I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
 I got the bubble kush and a sister could get ahead of it Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
 A high filled with dope
 Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
 With real nigga quotes
 Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote, control rap is out of
 Used to but still got love, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs
 Rock clubs like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
 Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you
 You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
 How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
 I'm here to resurrect me, mug is to sexy to even make songs like these
 That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
 To many featured emcees, and producers is popular
 Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her
 Album, how come, you the hot garbager
 The years clear your image and looped up
 Label got you suped up, telling you you sick
 Man you a dick with a loose nut
 Video hard to watch like Medusa
 Even your club record need a booster
 Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
 Read the infa', red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
 Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper
 You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way
 So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
 Spitting through wires and fires, emcees retiring
 Got yo hands up, get them mother***ers higher then Now, thr-thr-throw your mother***ing hands (Get 'em high!)
 All the girls pass the weed to your mother***ing man (Get 'em high!)
 Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
 And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)
