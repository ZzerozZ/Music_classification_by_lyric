                        Bài hát: Last Christmas - Wham

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
(You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
(Special)

Once bitten and twice shyed
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

(Merry Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you,' I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
(You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
(Special)

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
(Special)

Oh, oh my baby

Crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore him apart
Ooh hoo, now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
(You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
(Special)

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
(You gave me away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
(Special)

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
(Gave you my heart)
A man undercover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone
I'll give it to someone special
(Special)

Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone
I'll give it to someone special

Who'll give me something in return
(I'll give it to someone)
Hold my heart and watch it burn
(I'll give it to someone)
(I'll give it to someone)
(I'll give it to someone special)

I thought you were here to stay
How can you love me for a day?
I thought you were someone special!

Gave you my heart
(I'll give it to someone)
(I'll give it to someone)

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
You gave it away
(I'll give it to someone)
(I'll give it to someone)
