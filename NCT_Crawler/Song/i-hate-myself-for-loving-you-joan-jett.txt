                        Midnight gettin' uptight where are you

You said you meet me now its quarter to two

I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you



Hey jack its a fact they're talkin' in town

I turn my back and you're messin' around

I'm not really jealous don't like lookin' like a clown



I think of you every night and day

You took my heart then you took my pride away



I hate myself for loving you

Can't break free from the the things that you do

I wanna walk but I run back to you thats why

I hate myself for loving you



Daylight spent the night without you

But I've been dreamin' bout the lovin' you do

I won't be as angry 'bout the hell you put me through



Hey man bet you can treat me right

You just don't know what you was missin' last night

I wanna see your face and say forget it just from spite



I hate myself for loving you

Can't break free from the the things that you do

I wanna walk but I run back to you, thats why

I hate myself for loving you



I hate myself for loving you

Can't break free from the things that you do

I wanna walk but I run back to you thats why

I hate myself for loving you



I think of you every night and day

You took my heart then you took my pride away



I hate myself for loving you

Can't break free from the the things that you do

I wanna walk but I run back to you thats why

I hate myself for loving you

I hate myself for loving you

I hate myself for loving you.
