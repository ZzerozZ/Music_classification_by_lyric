                        [Verse 1]

Right, right, turn off the lights
We're gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the dealio?
I love when it's all too much
5 AM turn the radio up
Where's the rock 'n' roll?

Party crasher, penny snatcher
Call me up if you a gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

[Chorus]

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks

Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass?
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!

[Verse 2]

Slam, slam, oh hot damn
What part of "party" don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out
(Freak out already)

Can't stop, coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now
(So ***kin' on right now)

Party crasher, penny snatcher
Call me up if you a gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

[Chorus]

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks

Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass?
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!

Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass?
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!

(Oh *! My glass is empty... That sucks!)

[Bridge]

So if you're too school for cool
And you're treated like a fool
(You're treated like a fool)
You can choose to let it go
We can always, we can always party on our own

So raise your- 
(Aw *!)

[Chorus]

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks

Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass?
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!

Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass? (for me)
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass for me!
