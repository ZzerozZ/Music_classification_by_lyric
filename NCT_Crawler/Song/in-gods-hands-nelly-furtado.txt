                        I looked at your face I saw that all the love had died
 I saw that we had forgotten to take the time
 I, I saw that you couldn't care less about what you do
 You couldn't care less about the lies
 You couldn't find the time to cry We forgot about love
 We forgot about faith
 We forgot about trust
 We forgot about us Now our love's floating out the window
 Our love's floating out the back door
 Our love's floating up in the sky in Heaven
 Where it began back in God's hands You said that you had said all that you had to say
 You said, "Baby, it's the end of the day"
 And we gave a lot but it wasn't enough
 And we got so tired that we just gave up Now our love's floating out the window
 Our love's floating out the back door
 Our love's floating up in the sky in Heaven
 Where it began back in God's hands, back in God's hands We didn't respect it
 We went and neglected it
 We didn't deserve it
 But I never expected this Our love floated out the window
 Our love floated out the back door
 Our love floated up in the sky to Heaven
 It's part of a plan, it's back in God's hands
 Back in God's hands Oh, it didn't last, it's a thing of the past
 No, we didn't understand, oh, just what we had
 Oh, I want it back, just what we had
 I want it back, oh, just what we had
 No, we didn't understand, oh, just what we had
