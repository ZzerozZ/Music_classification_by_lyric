                        [Verse 1:]
If I could find assurance to leave you behind
I know my better half would fade
And all my doubt is a staircase for you
Opened out of this space
The first step is the one you believe in
The second one might be profound.

[Chorus:]
I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm.
I'll follow you down while we're passing through space
I don't care if we fall from grace
I'll follow you down

[Verse 2:]
You can have the money and the world
The angels and the pearls
Even trademark the color blue
Just like the tower we never built
In the shadow of all the guilt
When the other hand was pointed at you
Yeah the first step is the one you believe in
The second one might be profound.

[Chorus:]
I'll follow you down, through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm.
I'll follow you down, while we're passing through space
I don't care if we fall from grace
I'll follow you down to where forever lies
Without a doubt I'm on your side
There's nowhere else that I would rather be
I'm not about to compromise, give you up to say goodbye
I'll guide you through the deep I'll keep you close to me!

[Chorus]
I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm.
I'll follow you down while we're passing through space
I don't care if we fall from grace
I'll follow you..

If I could find assurance to leave you behind
I know my better half would fade
I'll follow you down.
