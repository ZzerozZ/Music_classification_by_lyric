                        Bài hát: Huntin', Fishin' And Lovin' Every Day - Luke Bryan

If I could make a livin' from walkin' in the woods
You can bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field down wind
If I could make a nickel off of turnin' them bass
Never worry bout the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in

Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day

I get a little farm pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pullin' the string on a 9.9 two-stroke (Mercury)
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go

And we get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here
Knee-deep in the Muckalee

Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes, let's go there in our minds

Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin, dark whiskey in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
