                        She would never say where she came from
 Yesterday don't matter 'cause it's gone
 While the sun is bright
 Or in the darkest night
 No one knows
 She comes and then she goes

 Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
 Who is gonna hang a name on you?
 And when you change with every new day
 Still I'm gonna miss you...

 Don't ask her why she needs to be so free
 She 's gonna tell you it's the only way to be
 She just can't be chained
 To a life where nothing's gained
 And nothing's lost
 At such a cost

 Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
 Who is gonna hang a name on you?
 And when you change with every new day
 Still I'm gonna miss you...

 There's no time to lose, I heard her say
 You got to catch your dreams before they runaway
 Dying all the time
 Lose your dreams
 And you, might will lose your mind.
 Ain't life unkind?

 Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
 Who is gonna hang a name on you?
 When you change with every new day
 Still I'm gonna miss you...

 Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
 Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
