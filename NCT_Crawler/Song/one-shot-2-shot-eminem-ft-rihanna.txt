                        I told ya'll motha***as I was comin' back
 (Oh ***)
 What now nigga, what now?
 (What are you doin'?)
 What?
 Proof, the projects, nigga One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
 This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
 Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off Security's gone I'm dropped in the club
 And I'm tryna run and get my mutha***in' gun
 (Nigga, what about your wife?)
 Nigga *** my wife, I'm tryin' ta run and save my mutha***in' life
 Oh ***, the shooter's comin' Bitches hollerin', niggas runnin', people shot all over the floor
 And I'm tryin' ta make it to the St. Andrew's door
 That's the sound of the glock
 Even DJ House ***ed around and got shot
 I done messed around and forgot my tec
 I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex (Kuniva you awright)
 These niggas is trippin'
 (Where's Bizarre at?)
 I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
 Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
 Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin' This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
 Sayin' she didn't mean to *** me earlier and she cryin'
 But it's real and it's on and cats is gettin' killed
 So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
 And she got hit now she's yellin'
 (Don't leave me) I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
 I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
 I ran and got my 38, I hope it's not too late One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
 This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
 Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off (I been tryna call you all day, motha***a, where you at?)
 I'm on seven mile, what the *** was that
 Damn somebody hit me from the back
 (With they car?)
 With a gat nigga and my tire flat
 And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes (Is you hit?)
 I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
 It was a black Mitsubishi
 (***, that's the clique we beefin' wit)
 Man and I was on my way there Believe me I'm leavin' a caucus today
 I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
 I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
 I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' *** these hoes up One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
 This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
 Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off I never seen no *** like this is my life before
 People are still camped out from the night before
 Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
 Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small
 People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd fans
 And some cum-wad from out the parkin' lot
 Gets in an argument over a parkin' spot
 Decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
 Into St. Andrew's hall, now the strays flyin' all over the place
 Sprays one bitch in the face, another one of 'em came through the wall
 Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off I'm posted up at the bar havin' a mazel tov
 Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
 Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
 And where the *** is Von, he usually tucks one on him Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
 No, I guess not, what the ***, oh my God it was
 I never saw him run so fast in my life
 Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife There she is on the ground bein' trampled
 I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her
 ***, there just went another damn bullet, I'm hit
 My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
 If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
 Follow Bizarre's path ran through it And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
 Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
 But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
 But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
 This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
 Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off It's Friday night came to this bitch, right
 Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
 I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
 Although I can't stay here to fight 'cuz I'm poppin' niggas tonight That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
 Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
 Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that the schmuck that
 Shot out the back of his truck is up in this motha***a So one shot for the money, two's to stop the show
 Third's for the bartender
 (There's plenty of shots to go)
 (I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)
 He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
 This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
 Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
