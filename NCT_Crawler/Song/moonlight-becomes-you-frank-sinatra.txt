                        You're all dressed up to go dreaming
 Now don't tell me I'm wrong
 And what a night to go dreaming
 Mind if I tag along Moonlight becomes, it goes with your hair
 You certainly know the right thing to wear
 Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
 And I could get so romantic tonight You're all dressed up to go dreaming
 Now don't you tell me I'm wrong
 What a night to go dreaming
 Mind if I tag along And if I say, "I love you"
 I want you to know
 It's not just because there's moonlight
 Although moonlight becomes you so
