                        Bài hát: Matches - Cash Cash, Rozes

I remember how we used to be so beautiful
You broke my heart at 16
The first time I felt my world come crashing
Black magic, like your heart was made of matches
And I never got over it

[Pre-Chorus 1: ROZES]
I swear your friends know when to post your photograph
It doesn’t really hurt, but it always takes me back to 16
In your basement and your parents, my feelings
And I never got over it

[Chorus: ROZES]
How did you break my heart without even trying?
How are you on my mind? You're not even talking to me
You were made of matches, and you burned me to the ground
You were made of matches, and you burned me down

[Verse 2: ROZES]
Everybody says that you're still living your life
One weekend to the next still tryna' get it right
The truth is I worry you never found something to escape who you used to be

[Pre-Chorus 2: ROZES]
I found my own way of coping with your mess
And I found my own reasons why you weren't the best for me
Why couldn't you be the best for me?

[Chorus: ROZES]
How did you break my heart without even trying?
How are you on my mind? You're not even talking to me
You were made of matches, and you burned me to the ground
You were made of matches, and you burned me down

[Outro: ROZES]
You were made of matches and you burned me down
I never got over it
I never got over it
                        
                    |
