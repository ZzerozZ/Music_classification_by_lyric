                        Bài hát: Whatever It Takes - Imagine Dragons

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, Nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Ya take me to the top, I’m ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of ‘em
Never be enough from the particle sum
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Ya take me to the top, I’m ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don’t wanna be the parenthetical
Hypothetical, working onto something that I’m proud of
Out of the box an epoxy to the world and the vision we’ve lost
I’m an apostrophe, I’m just a symbol to reminds you that there’s more to see
I’m just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I’m half diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and I happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Ya take me to the top, I’m ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
                        
                    |
