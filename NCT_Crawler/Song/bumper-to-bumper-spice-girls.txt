                        I'll beep my horn for you
(Bumper to bumper)
Give way I'm comin' through
I'll beep my horn for you
(Bumper to bumper)
Give way I'm comin' through
Drivin' through the city
Dirty, nitty gritty
Lookin' for a place to go
Girls are feelin' risky
Feelin' kinda frisky
Come on baby let me know
Pull over, pull over
You're driving me reckless
Over the limit
Alright, you're gonna get this
Bumper to bumper, bumper to bumper
I want to drive your body, all night
I want a back seat lover, all right
You know that
I'll beep my horn for you
(Bumper to bumper)
Give way I'm comin' through
(Bumper to bumper)
I'll beep my horn for you
(Bumper to bumper)
Can't take my eyes off you
(Bumper to bump)
Looking but no stoppin'
Only window shoppin'
Less you've got some goods to show
Don't tell us that were dirty
Only bein' flirty
Tops off and down and here we go
Pull over, pull over,
you're driving me reckless
Over the limit,
alright you're gonna get this
Bumper to bumper, bumper to bumper
I want to drive your body all night
I want a back seat lover, all right
You know that
I'll beep my horn for you
(Bumper to bumper)
Give way I'm comin' through
(Bumper to bumper)
I'll beep my horn for you
(Bumper to bumper)
Can't take my eyes off you
(Bumper to bumper)
Lazy hazy summer days
(Bump, bump)
Lazy hazy summer days
Lazy hazy summer days
(Bumper to bumper)
Drivin' in the sunshine, drivin' in the sunshine
(Lazy hazy summer days, lazy hazy summer days)
(Bump, bump)
(Lazy hazy summer days, lazy hazy summer days)
Drivin' in the sunshine, drivin' in the sunshine (Aahhh)
Drivin' in the sunshine
You know that
I'll beep my horn for you
(Bumper to bumper)
Give way I'm comin' through
(Bumper to bumper)
I'll beep my horn for you
(Bumper to bumper)
Can't take my eyes off you
(Bumper to bumper)
I'll beep my horn for you
(Bumper to bumper)
Give way I'm comin' through
(Bumper to bumper)
I'll beep my horn for you
(Bumper to bumper)
Can't take my eyes off you
(Bumper to bumper)
