                        It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 It don't matter, anyhow
 And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 If you don't know by now
 When your rooster crows at the breaks of dawn
 Look out your window and I'll be gone
 You're the reason I'm traveling on
 Don't think twice, it's all right.

 It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
 That light I never knowed
 And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
 I'm on the dark side of the road
 But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
 To try and make me change my mind and stay
 We never did too much talking anyway
 So don't think twice, it's all right.

 It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
 Like you never done before
 It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
 I can't hear you any more
 I'm a-thinking and a-wond'rin' walking down the road
 I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
 I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
 Don't think twice, it's all right.

 So long honey, babe
 Where I'm bound, I can't tell
 Goodbye's too good a word, babe
 So I'll just say fare thee well
 I ain't saying you treated me unkind
 You could have done better but I don't mind
 You just kinda wasted my precious time
 But don't think twice, it's all right.
