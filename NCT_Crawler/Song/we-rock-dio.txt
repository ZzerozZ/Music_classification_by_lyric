                        You watch their faces
 You'll see the traces
 Of the things they want to be
 But only we can see They come for killing
 They leave and still it seems
 The cloud that's left behind
 Oh, can penetrate your mind But sail on, sing a song, carry on
 Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock We pray to someone
 But when it's said and done
 It's really all the same
 With just a different name So many voices
 All giving choices
 If we listen they will say
 Oh, we can find the way But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on
 Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
 We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
 We Rock! We Rock
 You watch their faces
 You'll see the traces
 Of the things they want to be
 But only we can see They come for killing
 They leave and still it seems
 The cloud that's left behind
 Can penetrate your mind Sail on, sing a song, carry on
 Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
 We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock Ride out - stand and shout - carry on
 Sail on - Sing your song - carry on Cause We Rock, We Rock, see how We Rock
 We Rock
 That's rock
 We Rock
 We Rock
