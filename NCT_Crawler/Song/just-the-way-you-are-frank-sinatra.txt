                        Just you, just me
 Let's find a cozy spot to cuddle and coo
 Just us, just me
 I've miss an awful lot, my trouble is you Oh gee, what are your charms for?
 What are my arms for?
 Use your imagination Just you, just me
 I'll tie a lover's knot 'round wonderful you Oh gee, what are your charms for?
 What are my arms for?
 Use your imagination Just you, just me
 I'll tie a lover's knot 'round wonderful you Just us
