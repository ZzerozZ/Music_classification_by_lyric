 Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
 New York, NJ, N.C., VA
 We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
 Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
 Oaktown, L.A., San Fran, St. John People give your ears so I be sublime
 It's enjoyable to know you and the concubine
 Niggas, take off your coats ladies, act like gems
 Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
 See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the mo-mo
 Ludicrous, we speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
 Heard me in the eighties, J Beez on the promo
 On my never ending quest to get the paper on the caper
 But now, let me take it to the Queens side
 I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
 All the residential Questers to invade the way
 Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
 You can be a black man and lose all your soul
 You can be white and blue but don't *** the roll
 See my *** is universal, if you got knowledge and dolo
 Of delf for self, see there's no one else
 Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
 So, do that, do that, do do that that that(come on)
 Do that, do that, do do that that that(OK)
 Do that, do that, do do that that that
 I'm bugging out, so let me get back 'cause I'm wettin niggas
 So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothas
 I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
 So give me this award, and let's not make it the last We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
 Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
 Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
 We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
 Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
 Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas Back in '89, I simply slid into place
 Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
 A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
 Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case
 I have a quest to have the mic in my hand
 Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
 So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
 Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
 When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy
 Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
 Top notch baby, never coming less
 Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
 Sit back, relax, get up out the path
 If not that, here's the dance floor, come move that ass
 Non-believers, you can the steps
 I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
 Niggas know the time when the Quest is in the jam
 I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
 Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
 Living mad phat like an over sized Bam-bi
 The wackest crews try to dis, it makes me laugh
 When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
 So, next time that you think you want something here
 Make something deffer, take that garbage to St. Elsewhere We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
 Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
 S.C., Maryland, New Orleans, Motown
