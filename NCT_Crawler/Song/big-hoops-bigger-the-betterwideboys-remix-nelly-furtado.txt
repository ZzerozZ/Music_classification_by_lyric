 Tonight is the jam
 I'll be there till dawn
 I'm going down, I've got my big hoops on
 Pant leg so wide, I've got my backpack on
 I'm gonna hear my favorite song

 Hey hey hey, what's the scenario
 The boy keeps passin' my by
 I said no diggity, no doubt
 I thought I told you I was fly
 Yeah he and all of his friends they
 They got that hair like high five

 I don't wanna talk about sex
 Wanna express myself tonight

 I can go fast, I can go slow
 I can go places nobody else goes
 I can move fast, I can move slow
 I can go places nobody else goes

 Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day everybody say hey, 
 They goin' at it all night and day

 I betcha never seen something like that like that like that like that
 I betcha never heard something like that like that like that like that
 I betcha never seen something like that

 That boy gonna feel my poison
 I know it can stay in the rain
 Like you wanna be down with your baby
 Back and forth, back and forth
 Back, back, back and forth
 You got my rum rum shaking them another back
 When you should not real
 And I never have to fake it fake it
 You know I oughta move quick
 And I gotta move slow
 Cause there ain't no wind in the road

 I can go fast, I can go slow
 I can go places nobody else goes
 I can move fast, I can move slow
 I can go places nobody else goes

 Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day everybody say hey, 
 They goin' at it all night and day

 I betcha never seen something like that like that like that like that
 I betcha never heard something like that like that like that like that
 I betcha never seen something like that

 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The better the bigger

 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better

 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The better the bigger

 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better

 I betcha never seen something like that
 I betcha never heard something like that

 Oh I thought this song was over
 No, it ain't over yet

 I can go fast, I can go fast
 I can go fast

 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The better the bigger

 I can go fast

 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
 The bigger the better
