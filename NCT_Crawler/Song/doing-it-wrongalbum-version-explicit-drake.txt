                        [Verse:]
 When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
 It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
 And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
 And it's all because she don't want things to change

 [Hook:]
 So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
 That's the wrong thing to do
 Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
 That's the wrong thing to do
 Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
 That's the wrong thing to do
 Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
 And say I love you too

 But I need someone different
 You know it, oh ho, you know it
 Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
 I need someone different
 You know it, oh ho, you know it
 Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
 Something's been missing
 You know it, oh ho, she knows it
 Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
 I need someone different
 (Oh ho, oh ho)

 [Verse 2:]
 We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
 But we sure make it feel like we're together
 Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

 [Hook:]
 So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
 That's the wrong thing to do
 Touch if you need to I can't stay to hold you
 That's the wrong thing to do
 Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
 That's the wrong thing to do
 Cause you'll say you love me and i'll end up saying I love you too

 But I need someone diiferent
 You know it oh oh, You know it oh oh, You know we both know it
 I need someone different
 You know it oh oh, You know it oh oh, you know it we both know it
 Somethings been missing
 You know it oh oh, She knows it oh oh, I know it we all know it
 I need someone different
