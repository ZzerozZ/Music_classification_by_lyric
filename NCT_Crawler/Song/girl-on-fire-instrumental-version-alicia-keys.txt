                        [Verse 1]
 She's just a girl and she's on fire
 Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
 She's living in a world and it's on fire
 Fill with catastrophe, but she know she can fly away

 [Pre-Chorus]
 Ooooohhhh...
 She got both feet on the ground
 And she's burning it down
 Oooohhhhh...
 She got her head in the clouds
 And she's not backing down

 [Chorus]
 This girl is on fire
 This girl is on fire
 She's walking on fire
 This girl is on fire

 [Verse 2]
 Looks like a girl but she's a flame
 So bright she can burn your eyes
 Better look the other way
 You can try but you'll never forget her name
 She's on top of the world
 Hottest of the hottest girls say

 [Pre-Chorus]
 Oh, we got our feet on the ground
 And we're burning it down
 Oh, got our head in the clouds
 And we're not coming down

 [Chorus]
 This girl is on fire
 This girl is on fire
 She's walking on fire
 This girl is on fire

 [Bridge]
 Everybody stands as she goes by
 Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
 Watch her when she's lighting up the night
 Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
 And it's a lonely world
 But she gon' let it burn baby burn baby

 [Chorus]
 This girl is on fire
 This girl is on fire
 She's walking on fire
 This girl is on fire

 [Outro]
 Oh, oh, oh... 

 She's just a girl, and she's on fire
                        
                    |
