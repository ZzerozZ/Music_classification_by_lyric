Country|

                        I remember when I was a lad
 Times were hard and things were bad
 But there's a silver linin' behind every cloud
 Just poor people that's all we were
 Tryin' to make a livin' out of black land earth
 But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
 Me and little brother would join right in there
 Singin' seems to help a troubled soul
 One of these days and it won't be long
 I'll rejoin them in a song
 I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne No, the circle won't be broken
 By and by, Lord, by and by
 Daddy'll sing bass, Mama'll sing tenor
 Me and little brother will join right in there
 In the sky, Lord, in the sky Now I remember after work
 Mama would call in all of us
 You could hear us singin' for a country mile
 Now little brother has done gone on
 But I'll rejoin him in a song
 We'll be together again up yonder in a little while Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
 Me and little brother would join right in there
 Singin' seems to help a troubled soul
 One of these days and it won't be long
 I'll rejoin them in a song
 I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne No, the circle won't be broken
 By and by, Lord, by and by
 Daddy'll sing bass, Mama'll sing tenor
 Me and little brother will join right in there
 In the sky, Lord, in the sky
 In the sky, Lord, in the sky
