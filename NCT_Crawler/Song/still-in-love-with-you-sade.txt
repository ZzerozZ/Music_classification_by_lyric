                        Bài hát: Still In Love With You - Sade

Think I'll just fall to pieces
If I don't find something else to do
This sadness never ceases
I'm still in love with you

My head, it keeps on reeling
It's got me in a crazy spin
Darling, darling, darling
Is this the end?

Still in love with you

They say time has a way of healing
Dries all the tears from your eyes
But darling it's this empty feeling
My heart can't disguise

After all that we've been through
I try my best but it's no use
I guess I'll keep on loving you
Is this the end?

Now that it's all over, woman
There's something I think you should know
Baby, baby, think it over
Just one more time before you go

Call on me baby
If there's anything I can do for you
Call on me baby
Help me see it through

I'm still in love with you
                        
                    |
