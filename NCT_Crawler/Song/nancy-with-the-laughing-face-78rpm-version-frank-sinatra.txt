                        If I don't see her each day, I miss her
 Gee what a thrill, each time I kiss her
 Believe me, I've got a case
 On nancy, with the laughing face

 She takes the winter and makes it summer
 And summer could take some lessons from her
 Picture a tomboy in lace
 That's nancy with the laughing face

 Have you ever heard mission bells ringing
 Well she'll give you the very same glow
 When she speaks you would think it was singing
 Just hear her say hello

 I swear to goodness, you can't resist her
 She's mighty sweet, and wait till you see her sister
 No angel could replace
 Nancy, with the laughing face
                        
                    |
