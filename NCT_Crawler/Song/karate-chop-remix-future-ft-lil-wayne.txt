R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        You know, this just some real nigga ***, a real nigga story
 You know what I'm saying? Slang a bunch of narcotics
 Pull up in the new 'rarri
 Living like John Gotti
 Chopping bricks like karate
 Drink a bunch of codeine
 Serving to the dope fiends
 Blowing money, stay clean
 Michael Jackson, Billy Jean Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
 Got a young bitch pulling up in a vet
 Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
 Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
 Bitch nigga get money, nigga get that
 Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
 You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
 I can whoop a Maserati, pulling up a donk
 50,000 on yo watch, young nigga splurge
 Pop a Ace of Spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
 Keep a young nigga workin' gotta bus' a K
 I'ma take a phone call, hustle everyday Slang a bunch of narcotics
 Pull up in the new 'rarri
 Living like John Gotti
 Chopping bricks like karate
 Drink a bunch of codeine
 Serving to the dope fiends
 Blowing money, stay clean
 Michael Jackson, Billy Jean Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider
 Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer
 Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
 I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
 In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle
 Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya
 Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's
 We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
 Got the girl dripping wet like a Jheri curl
 Got a styrofoam cup and its full of syrup
 Send it over from Lil Mexico & Let me Work
 I can get 36 for a clean shirt Slang a bunch of narcotics
 Pull up in the new 'rarri
 Living like John Gotti
 Chopping bricks like karate
 Drink a bunch of codeine
 Serving to the dope fiends
 Blowing money, stay clean
 Michael Jackson, Billy Jean Pop a lot of pain pills
 'Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels
 Beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
 Yeah,
 Two cell phones ringin' at the same time
 That's your ho, callin' from two different phones
 Tell that bitch "leave me the *** alone!"
 See, you *** her wrong, and I *** her long
 I got a love-hate relationship with Molly
 I'd rather pop an ollie, and my dick is a trolly
 Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
 And these hoes say I'm blind,
 Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
 Man I just received a package
 Them other niggas taxin'
 And my pockets so fat, I'm startin' to feel contractions
 And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
 And he already home and that nigga must be snitchin'
 Cut him off like karate! Slang a bunch of narcotics
 Pull up in the new 'rarri
 Living like John Gotti
 Chopping bricks like karate
 Drink a bunch of codeine
 Serving to the dope fiends
 Blowing money, stay clean
 Michael Jackson, Billy Jean
