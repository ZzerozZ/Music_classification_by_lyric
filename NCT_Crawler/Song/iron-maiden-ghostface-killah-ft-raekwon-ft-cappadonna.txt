                        {What you doin' on our turf, punk? Got a message for Smokey
 Give it, you Smokey, man? Give it
 If you ain't Smokey, it ain't yo' mother***in' message
 Mother***er, I said gimme the message} {It's from Willie, in the slam, nigga, you been busted?
 Yeah, the man picked me up
 Well, I ain't got no ***in' time to play witchu
 Now gimme the message} {Willie's in Warwick, doin' 1 to 3, told me to tell y'all mother***ers
 To keep cool, he be out one way or another, quick
 Maybe I could stick around for awhile, naw, that's out, man
 You know? What can we, The Lords, do with a punk like you?} {***, mother***er, burn 'em
 Just me and you, mother***er, just me and you
 I put trademarks around your ***in' eye} Portrayin', won't be payin', uh huh, uh huh
 Yeah, no doubt, no doubt, this Wally champ cat
 Yeah, it's on this one Yo, Gambino niggas, who swipe theirs
 Deluxe rap cavaliers, midgets who steal beers, give 'em theirs
 Sit back jollyin', my team be gamin'
 Like three card Rolly an' drug Somalians pollyin' Many raps they crochetin', ay yo, Iron
 These niggas portrayin' but haven't been payin'
 For real, slide on these niggas, like flesh fear
 Caesar fade style, usually tough grenade Throw a blade, *** gettin' laid
 Guzzle this *** like Gatorade
 Big-dick Wallies have, never half-suede
 Connectin' with the hot style is done Light up a challis
 I run with nuttin' but the wildest, foulest
 Come on now, long dick style
 Niggas on the hit out, ay yo, Iron, bite my *** out Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally
 Been doin' this century kid, just meant to be
 Get on your knees an' bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
 Skiin' off by P.M. Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
 Fellatium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians
 The greatest lesson is 'Don't owe, you might get stole on'
 When I go bury me wit Valow on {They come to me and understand just let me get mines first
 Then after I get mines, y'all can do what y'all wanna do
 *** 'em up bad} 'Sho 'nuff, hit the bank an' thrust
 Cool Nauticas, Jamie Summer got trained on the tour bus
 We upgrade, swallow raw eggs, read the label
 Hittin' white label, left the Winnebago unstable Smooth sailin', walked in, my earth started kneelin'
 Started stealin', I'm too ill, see, we're bellin' at the parlay
 Kicked up, mack, max motion
 Michael Bolton magazine call, I'm too potent Louisville mix pain kill rap, *** Benadryl
 The violin in 'Knowledge God' sounded ill
 Tremendously obnoxious, no blotches
 My telephone watch'll leave bartenders topless Dead on the prosecutor, smacked a juror
 Me an' my girl'll run like Luke an' Laura
 We sit back on Malayan Islands
 Sippin' mix drinks out of boat, coconut bowls, we whylin' Sit back jollyin', uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
 Sit back jollyin', uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh Sit back jollyin', my team be gamin'
 Like three card Rolly an' drug Somalians pollyin'
 Sit back jollyin', my team be gamin'
 Like three card Rolly an' drug Somalians pollyin' Sit back Deep meditation, sound orientated, war the blizzard
 Rap para-medical, the wizard
 Cappadonna, never caterin' to none
 My microphone an' three verse weigh a ton of slaughter You oughta, five thousand, back across the water
 My laboratory story keep me flowin' with the glory
 Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
 I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew One gallon of whylin', Park Hill profilin'
 I cut your face up, rough fifty, sure while you're smilin'
 For violatin' my position
 I leave you smoked like a crack head on a mission Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance
 Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
 Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy
 You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me 'Cause I'm P L O T K O every day
 Dance hall General, party fanatic colonel
 Cappadonna, son'a old school just go infernal
 Veteran for rappin' with the new set of rule of hard rappin' Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clappin'
 When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle
 I spark the mic an' Shaolin spark the methtical
 Every evenin' I have a by myself meetin' Thinkin' who's gonna be the next to catch a beatin'
 From my mental slangin', bitchin', rap twist the point of warfare
 I brutalize, all competition catch ill hair
 Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
 I jacked it, stripped the beat naked an' packed it, gimme my rewards {The way I, the way I wanna get 'em, I want 'em gotten
 I want 'em layin' out, I want 'em gotten
 'Cause niggas need to be gotten, he need to be taken off of here
 That's straight}
