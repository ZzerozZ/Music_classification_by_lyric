 I'm gonna leave you yes I'm gonna
 I'm gonna leave you cos I wanna
 And I'll go where people love me
 And I'll stay there cos they love me

 No more headaches no more heartbreaks
 I'm gonna leave you where I met you
 I'm gonna leave you whit your money
 I want somebody to call me honey

 I don't want gold rings
 I wanna hear sweet things
 I need affection and not protection
 When you're teasing you should be squeezing

 I'm gonna leave you where I met you
 Yes I'm pulled up with your person
 And I'm pulled up with your person
 And I waited getting frustrated

 I'm old fashioned I want my passion
 So I'm leaving though I'm grieving
 I'm gonna leave you where I met you

 I'm gonna leave you
 When you're teasing you should be squeezing
 I'm gonna leave you

 I'm gonna leave you cos I'm gonna
 Yes I'm gonna leave you cos I wanna
 And I'll go where people love me
 And I'll stay there cos they love me

 No more headaches no more heartbreaks
 I'm gonna leave you where I met you
 I'm gonna leave you whit your money
 I want somebody to call me honey

 I don't want gold rings
 I wanna hear sweet things
 I need affection and not protection
 When you're teasing you should be squeezing

 I'm gonna leave you where I met you
 Yes I'm pulled up with your person
 And I'm pulled up with your person
 And I waited getting frustrated

 I'm old fashioned I want my passion
 So I'm leaving though I'm grieving
 I'm gonna leave you where I met you
