                        Work your thing out, out, out
 Work your thing out, out, out
 Work your thing out, out, out
 Work your thing out, out, out There's so many of you girls, I hear you been runnin'
 From the beautiful queen that you can be becomin
 You can look in my palm and see the storm comin
 Read the book of my life and see Ive overcome it Just because the length of your hair ain't long
 And they often criticize you for your skin tone
 Go on and hold your head high cause you a pretty woman
 Get your runway stride honed and keep it goin
 Girl, live your life I just wanna be myself
 Don't sweat girl be yourself
 Follow me, follow me, follow me, girl be yourself
 Thats why I be myself and I grew to love it (Work your thing out, out, out)
 Let em get mad
 They gon hate anyway, don't you get that?
 (Work your thing out, out, out)
 Doesn't matter if you go along with their plan
 (Work your thing out, out, out)
 They'll never be happy cause they're not happy with themselves
 (Work your thing out, out, out) (Ah, ah, work what you got)
 I'm talkin about things that I know
 (Ah, ah, work what you got)
 It's okay show yourself some love
 (Ah, ah, work what you got)
 Don't worry about who's sayin what
 (It's gonna be fine, work what you got)
 Work what you got Feelin great because the light's on me
 Celebratin the things that everyone told me would never happen
 But God has put his hands on me
 And ain't a man alive could ever take it from me Workin with what I got, I gotta keep on
 Takin care of myself, I wanna live long
 Ain't never ashamed what life did to me
 Wasn't afraid to change cause it was good for me
 I wanna I just wanna be myself
 Don't sweat girl be yourself
 Follow me, follow me, follow me, I be myself
 Thats why I be myself and I grew to love it (Work your thing out, out, out)
 Let em get mad
 They gon hate anyway, don't you get that?
 (Work your thing out, out, out)
 Doesn't matter if you go along with their plan
 (Work your thing out, out, out)
 They'll never be happy cause they're not happy with themselves
 (Work your thing out, out, out) (Ah, ah, work what you got)
 I'm talkin about things that I know
 (Ah, ah, work what you got)
