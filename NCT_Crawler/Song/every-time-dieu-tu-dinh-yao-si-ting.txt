                        Bài hát: Every Time - Yao Si Ting (Diêu Tư Đình)

I'm afraid I'm starting to feel
What I said I would not do
The last time really hurt me

I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
Cuz everytime I fall in love
It seems to never last

CHORUS:
But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
Cuz every time I see your face
My heart does begin to race everytime

One half wants me to go
One half wants me to stay
I just get so all confused

I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
Cuz every time I fall in love
It seems to never last

I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
Cuz everytime I fall in love
It seems to never last

CHORUS

I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
Cuz everytime I fall in love
It seems to never last

CHORUS

It's everytime
It's everytime
Cuz. . .

Everytime your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
Cuz every time I see your face
Could it be that this will be the one that lasts?
The fear does start to erase every time
Oh could it be that this will be the one that lasts
For all my times
Ooh yeah
For all my times
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last
                        
                    |
