Good Charlotte - The River
(feat. M Shadows & Synyster Gates from Avenged Sevenfold)

As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of LA
The footsteps that were next to me
have gone their separate ways
I\'ve seen enough now
to know that beautiful things
don\'t always stay that way
I\'ve done enough now
to know this beautiful place
isn\'t everything they say

I heard that evil comes disguised
Like a city of angels
I\'m walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I\'ve seen a vision of my life
And I wanna be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I\'ve done a lot of things wrong
But I swear I\'m a believer
Like the prodigal son
I was out on my own
Now I\'m trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I\'m delivered
I\'m delivered

You\'re from a small town
you\'re gonna grow up fast
underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood on the boulevard
the dead come back to life
To the praying Mother
The worried Father

Let your children go
If they come back they\'ll come home stronger
and if they don\'t you\'ll know

They sing that evil comes disguised
Like a city of angels
I\'m walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I\'ve seen a vision of my life
And I wanna be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I\'ve done a lot of things wrong
But I swear I\'m a believer
Like the prodigal son
I was out on my own
Now I\'m trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I\'m delivered
I\'m delivered

Baptized in the river (on my own)
Baptized in the river (on my own)
I wanna be delivered
(on my own)
(on my own)
Baptized in the river (on my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (on my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (on my own)
I wanna be delivered

I confess I\'m a sinner
I\'ve seen a vision of my life
And I wanna be delivered
