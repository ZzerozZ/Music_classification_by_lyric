                        I know life is different to you
 First love can be frightening that's true
 But take me as your brother and your friend
 And take me as your lover and your man Pretty young girl of my mind
 How I wish you to be mine
 Girl, you're no child anymore Pretty young girl of my mind
 Don't you know? Know I can't hide
 Can't hide my feelings
 You're my girl and you're sixteen Don't know, is it wrong, is it right?
 Sweet girl, I wanna love you tonight
 So take me as your brother and your friend
 But first of all, I wanna be your man Pretty young girl of my mind
 How I wish you to be mine
 Girl you're no child anymore Pretty young girl of my mind
 Don't you know, know I can't hide
 Can't hide my feelings
 You're my girl and you're sixteen Pretty young girl of my mind
 How I wish you to be mine
 Girl you're no child anymore Pretty young girl of my mind
 Don't you know, know I can't hide
 Can't hide my feelings
 You're my girl and you're sixteen
