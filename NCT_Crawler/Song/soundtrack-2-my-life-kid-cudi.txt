                        Bài hát: Soundtrack 2 My Life - Kid Cudi

I got 99 problems and they all bitches
I wish I was Jigga Man, carefree living
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm a Cleveland nigga rolling with them Brooklyn boys
You know how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the drama
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself, why he by himself?
He got two older brothers, one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see, the little bit of sadness in me, Scotty

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 2]
I'm super paranoid, like a 6th sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I tried to think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time nobody gave a ***
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My hearts an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancun
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try to shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand fame

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 3]
i was close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending be slitting my throat
Ignorance to cope man
Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love, and I need that ***
If I never did shows, then I'd probably be a myth
If I cared about the blogs, then I'd probably be a jackass
Who give a *** what people talk about fame
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down, pussy and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

To my life [8x]
