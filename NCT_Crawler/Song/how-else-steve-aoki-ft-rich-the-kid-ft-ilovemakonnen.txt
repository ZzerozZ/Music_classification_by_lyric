                        Bài hát: How Else - Steve Aoki, Rich The Kid, iLoveMakonnen

[iLoveMakonnen:]
Yeah
I'm tired of all this whippin' in the kitchen
But how else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?

[Rich The Kid:]
I put her in Givenchy
I got these bitches trippin'
Was young, I wanted a Bentley
I promise I'm gon' whip it
How else am I gon' get it?
I had to trap in a vacant
Swerving a Rari in Vegas
Mama we finally made it
Little bit of racks, I'm a trapstar
She ride me like a pornstar
I'mma stack the bricks in the backyard
Taught her how to whip it, turn the white hard
I can't take her on a date, this ain't chicken dinner
Put my wrist in the pot, I could make it flip up

[iLoveMakonnen:]
I'm tired of all this whippin' in the kitchen
But how else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
I'm getting kinda tired of all this cooking in the kitchen
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?

Whip
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
Whip
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon', gon', gon'
Whip
You know my *** is the best
I feel like I should stop and retire as a vet
And probably maybe put on a new ***
Oh, damn I'm on the cruise ship

I'm tired of all this whippin' in the kitchen
But how else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
I'm getting kinda tired of all this cooking in the kitchen
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?

Whip
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
Whip
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
