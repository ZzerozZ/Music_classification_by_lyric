                        I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed.
I felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed.

Goodbye!

I wipe it of on tile, the light is brighter this time
Everything is 3D blasphemy 
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?

I felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander around where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Get outta my head cuz I don't need this
Why didn't I see this? I'm a victim - Manchurian candidate
I - have - sinned - by - just
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away!

I felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander around where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
I felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear that stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed.

Goodbye!

You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free

I felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell I wait and bleed
I felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed.

AND IT WAITS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
