                        [SPOKEN:]
 Hey, come here for a second
 I don't like the way he treats you
 He doesn't deserve you
 He really don't

 What kind of man
 Would leave you standing in the cold
 Must've been a silly one
 To sacrifice a pot of gold
 You're the kind of woman
 That needs a man that's always there
 It's not that you require a lot
 Just need some tender love and care

 I give good love
 I'll buy your clothes
 I'll cook your dinner too
 Soon as I get home from work
 I'll pay your rent
 Your faithful lover
 Soon as I get home, soon as I get home from work
 Girl, I'll treat you right
 And I'll never lie
 For all that it's worth
 I give good love (good love, good love, good love, good love)

 It doesn't make sense
 That you should have a broken heart
 If I were the only one
 I'd never let you fall apart
 You're the kind of woman
 That needs a man with lots of cash
 With a stack of major credit cards
 And with me you don't have to ask

 I give good love
 I'll buy your clothes
 I'll cook your dinner too
 Soon as I get home from work
 I'll pay your rent
 Your faithful lover
 Soon as I get home, soon as I get home from work
 Girl, I'll treat you right
 And I'll never lie or flirt
 Soon as I get home, soon as I get home from work
 Girl I'll be around, never let you down
 For all that it's worth
 I give good love (good love, good love, good love, good love)
 I give good love (good love, good love, good love, good love)
