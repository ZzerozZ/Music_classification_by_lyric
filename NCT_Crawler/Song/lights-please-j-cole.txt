                        Uh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh [Verse One]
 I had this little bad thing somethin' like them 10's
 She gave a nigga mad brain somethin' like the wiz
 But you see the sad thing fuckin' with her is
 Is the chick ain't even have brains dummy like a bitch
 So I tried to show her
 About the world and about just who we really are
 And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
 Like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard
 But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
 Then all I really want is for her to go down low
 Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow
 And all that deep *** I was previously down for
 Replaced by freak *** I am currently down for
 You see I peeped it, pussy is power
 That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
 And how it feels to feel that feelin' you feelin' when you be drillin' that ***
 Got her sayin' you be killin' that ***
 And all the pain the world cause
 She be healin' that ***
 And nah that ain't your girl dog
 But you be feelin' that chick
 And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
 But in the mean time it's lights please [Hook]
 Lights please
 Lights please
 Turn off the lights
 For now everything just seems so right
 And how you make darkness seem so bright
 Feelin' like things gon' be alright Lights please
 Lights please
 Turn off the lights
 For now everything just seems so right
 And how you make darkness seem so bright
 Feelin' like things gon' be alright
 Lights please [Verse Two]
 So now we in the hotel
 Mirrors on the ceilin'
 She say she wanna blow L's
 I hear her and I'm willin'
 But everytime I smoke well a nigga mind gone
 So that every word I spoke well I'm tryin' to put her on
 But she couldn't hear me
 I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
 And that they'd love to see us all go to prison or die
 Like baby look at how they show us on the TV screen
 But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
 Then all I really want is for her to get on top
 Before you know it she workin' jerkin' it non stop
 And all that next *** I was previously talkin'
 Is now that wet *** that I'm currently lost in
 And while that sweat drip I am reminded
 All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
 I'm findin' the more I grow the more y'all stay the same
 Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin' to play the game
 And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
 To a baby that took two to make
 Coward nigga you a fake
 How gon' look in your sons face and turn your back
 Then go start another family dog what type of *** is that?
 She said it's okay
 Rubbed my head and told me to relax
 Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin' tracks
 Said I know you wanna change the world
 But for the night please
 Just reach over and hit the lights please [Hook]
 Lights please
 Lights please
 Turn off the lights
 For now everything just seems so right
 And how you make darkness seem so bright
 Feelin' like things gon' be alright Lights please
 Lights please
 Turn off the lights
 For now everything just seems so right
 And how you make darkness seem so bright
 Feelin' like things gon' be alright
 Lights please [Outro]
 Uh uh uh
 Lights please
 Uh uh uh
 Lights please
 Uh uh uh
 Lights please
 Turn off the lights
 Lights Please
 Yeah
 That's it
