                        Bài hát: Fox On The Run - Sweet

[Verse 1]
I - don't wanna know your name
Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before
Okay - you think you got a pretty face
But the rest of you is out of place
You looked alright before

[Chorus]
Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Foxy on the run
F-foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away

[Verse 2]
You - you talk about just every band
But the names you drop are second hand (second hand)
I've heard it all before
I - don't wanna know your name
Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before

[Chorus]
Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Foxy on the run
F-foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away

[Chorus 2]
F-foxy
Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Foxy is on the run
F-foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away
(Fox on the run)
(Fox on the run)
(Fox on the run)
(Fox)
