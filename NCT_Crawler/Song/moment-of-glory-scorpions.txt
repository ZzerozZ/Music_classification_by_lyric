Trình Bày: Scorpions
A moment of glory called evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning, a moment of freedom
Like angels are singing a song full of joy
This side of heaven
Belongs to the children
I will be there, when the future arrives
A moment of glory called evolution
Could I fly away like a bird in the sky
No limitation, a new inspiration
A world that is free just as free as my mind
Communication
A new destination
The planet of visions is calling tonight
Another thousand years seems so long
I'm just a passenger
And the ride has just begun
Moment of glory
A moment of glory called evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning, a moment of freedom
Like angels are singing a song full of joy
This side of heaven
Belongs to the children
I will be there, when the future arrives
Moment of glory
Moment of glory
Moment of glory
Moment of glory
