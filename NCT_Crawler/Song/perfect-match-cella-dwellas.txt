                        Perfect combination
 Ain't no other relationship
 Like this
 I know we're gonna last forever

 At the edge of my bed I sit back and reminisce
 Long talks and walks and also your soft kiss
 We went shopping at Macy's, skating at Lacey's
 Cut off all my dime pieces, even thick Stacey
 Thinkin' in this rental blastin' instrumentals
 How we first met was all on my mental
 It was at Great Adventure, the 'Batman Ride'
 Thought I was deaded 'cause first this fat man tried

 The sun, beamin', federation schemin'
 But you was clockin' Dibiase, musta been day-dreamin'
 Waitin' on line, wishin' she was all mine
 Shootin' the gift, exchanged digits, the whole nine
 Spent about 850 in Atlantic City
 After you, boo, my attitude is real
 Scenery sunny, act one, near a money machine
 Jumped out the cream Lex with Jacks, she rocked a black tennis skirt

 With Stan Smith's, about a size 6
 Jewels, chinky eyes, long hair, bow legged, her thighs
 Was thick like she ran track, for what it's worth
 Shortie was made from the best things on this Earth
 Like a Snapple I wanted to drink her to quench my thirst
 Jumped in the coupe and threw my joint in reverse
 Hey boo, I was watchin' you
 Here's my number, call me at the crib at 2

 Perfect combination
 There's no other relationship

 Hey yo, tell me what went wrong to make me write this song
 Used to have it going on, our feelings was so strong
 Your age 26, my number one draft pick
 From all the rest, got first dibs plus your own crib
 You just flew back in town, from where, son? From Dallas
 And said she wants the Tall Man to come to her palace
 I'm over there tonight to watch the Bulls catch licks
 From the Knicks and at halftime I watch Rod Strick's

 Get bizzynizm, I feel lucky to shoot the gizm
 In her triangular prism, and that's the realism
 Where does she live, kid? Out in Bed-Stuy
 Do or die, come on now, baby, 'cause I'm packin'
 I got the phone call at 2, it's me, boo, oh
 She said, "You know, why don't you come to the crib-o?
 We could wine and dine and relax on the low
 And drink Mo', by the way, I just saw your video"

 Yeah, true, I'm comin' through, give me a hour
 Jumped out the shower and buried my body in baby powder
 Dipped wears plus my hair smells like Nexus
 Yo, I jump into the Lexus
 On the highway, it's a Friday, can't wait to see her
 I picked up two slices from the local pizzeria

 Perfect combination

 Got to the crib about 8, she told me wait in the living room
 Be back real soon, on hbo tonight is, 'Platoon'
 Laid back in this recliner, s** on my minder
 Playin' Pitty Pat watchin', 'Fritz the Cat'
 Whip in the drive-way and do wanna club, playin' Nas 'One Love'
 Drinkin O. E., she told me her address was double 0-3
 I slowly walked up the steps and rung her back bell
 Talkin on my cell

 I skated to the back, I see Black Knights and smell Fahrenheit
 That's when shortie took flight
 What's the deal, fam? What's the real plan, shortie flashed
 Knockin' over trash like she was runnin' a 40 yard dash
 Let's hit the club and start from scratch
 'Cause all I wanted us to be was the perfect match

 Perfect combination
 You know, perfect combination
 Perfect combination
 You know, perfect combination
