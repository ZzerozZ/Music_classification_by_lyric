                        In Your Head
[Mohombi]
She's waiting for her man to go to work
Then calls me on the phone saying he's such a jerk
I feel like a thief in the day and a thief in the night
But it's just a fight
Why why why don't he treat you right
He should be the one to apologise
Going upstairs, get away from the past
Then the phone rings I hear your husband ask
"someone in the back, who's that who's that who's that who's that"

[Hook]
In your head

Who's in your head

[Mohombi]
He ain't falling for your lies
He got a private eye
But I pass him in the sky
tryna look through your blinds
What is your report to your man
Is he really should have listened while he had that chance

You told him what you like and what you hate
And now I stole your heart and it's way too late
You really really didn't have the business
Now i'm all up all up all up in your business
Now you know who this is
Fulfilling all your wishes

In your head

Who's in your head

[Bridge]
Just say my name right
Just say my name right
I feel your pain right
I feel your pain right

Told the girl to be quiet quiet
If they hear your voice they'll be a riot riot
Your man's outside with them dudes waiting for me
But I'm gonna stay appeased
If they wanna wait all day
All day gonna hears what I play
Boom boom boom from the bedroom
Grab your girl and zoom zoom zoom
