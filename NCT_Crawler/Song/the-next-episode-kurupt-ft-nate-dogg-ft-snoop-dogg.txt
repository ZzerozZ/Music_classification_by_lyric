Bitches lookin' at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this mother *er just a-swangin' my hair
Bitch quit talkin', Crip walk if if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the X you'll be relievin' your stress
