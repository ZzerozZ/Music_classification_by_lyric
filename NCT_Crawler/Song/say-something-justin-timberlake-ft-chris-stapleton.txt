                        Bài hát: Say Something - Justin Timberlake, Chris Stapleton

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Oh, yeah, alright
Ooh

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still I don't go there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Everybody says say something
Say something, say something
Say something, say something
I don't wanna get caught, up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight (whoa)
I hear them call my name

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everybody says say something
Say something, say something
Say something, say something
I don't want to get caught, up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing

[Chorus 2: Both & Justin Timberlake]
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing
                        
                    |
