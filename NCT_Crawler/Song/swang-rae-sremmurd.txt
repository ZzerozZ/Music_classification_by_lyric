                        Bài hát: Swang - Rae Sremmurd

[Intro]
Um, it's nasty
Uh, it's nasty
Uhmm
Know some young niggas like to swang, uhmm
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
Hop out, drop, top, *** y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Gettin' dough ain't a thing change
Coasting, grippin' grain
Goin' through the money like a phase
Don't say my name in vain
I'm so glad that you came
All these bad bitches gettin' slain
Broke ass nigga get a clue
All these niggas know how we do

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
Hop out, drop, top, *** y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
I know some young niggas from the bottom
They'll do anything for a dollar
I coulda went to school to be a doctor
But I dropped out and chose to be a baller
Switchin' lanes, spittin' game in my new drop
Still on a paper chase that don't ever stop
Everybody with me family, that's how we rock
Party at the mansion, we bout to flood the spot
Sremmlife!

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
