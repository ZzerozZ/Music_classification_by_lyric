                        Bài hát: Love - Dean, Syd

You give me something I need in my life
Second to nothing you come baby
Told you I loved you you told me you might
Tell me why you frontin' babe
Say you want to take it slow
When you're ready let me know
I know somewhere we can go to unwind
Leave your troubles in the past
And give love another chance
You got questions I got answers tonight

I got intentions baby
But I'm gettin' restless babe
I need your blessing baby
I'll love you if you let me baby
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know

Got a lot of emotion it's a rollercoaster but I like it
Should I wait in line should
I close my eyes or should I ride it out
Don't know where we're goin'
Let's live in the moment
Something about you I'm so in to
Say you want to take it slow
When you're ready let me know
I got somewhere we can go to unwind
I been patient I been true
I been playing by the rules
Tell your friends I got you alright yea

I got intentions baby
But I'm gettin' restless babe
I need your blessin' baby
I'll *** you if you let me baby
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
(Love - love - love)

You wonder where is the love where is the love
You've been looking for feelings of love
Yeah I'm out of control
Whether it's right or wrong no
If its mean to be we will know

I got intentions baby
But I'm gettin' restless babe
I need your blessin' baby
I'll love you if you let me baby
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know

Turn that *** off!
It's all about the things you do
That makes me wanna turn to you
It's all about the dreams you grew
That gives my life another view
It's all about the things you do
That makes me wanna turn to you
It's all about the dreams you grew
That gives my life another view
Where is the love is the love is the love
