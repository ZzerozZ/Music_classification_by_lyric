                        Bài hát: The Wolf (From "Fifty Shades Freed (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)") - The Spencer Lee Band

Just like the rain outside
Your body sweating, dripping' wet
And I just can't control myself, no, baby
Be my obsession
My possession
Baby, I got fine selection
This must be your lucky day, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna jack it, smack it
You know the *** that turns you on?
I wanna lick it, kiss it
I'll give you everything you want

[Chorus]
Howling out your name
Red like champagne
You're gonna feel the vibes
When the wolf comes out tonight
When the wolf comes out tonight
When the wolf comes out tonight

[Verse 2]
I watch you burn this place to ashes
Move that ass
And raise a glass to how you love to misbehave, baby
Be my addiction
My prescription
Baby, I got a condition
It must be your lucky day


[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna jack it, smack it
You know the *** that turns you on?
I wanna lick it, kiss it
I'll give you everything you want

[Chorus]
Howling out your name
Red like champagne
You're gonna feel the vibes
When the wolf comes out tonight
When the wolf comes out tonight
When the wolf comes out tonight
When the wolf comes out tonight

[Bridge]
I wanna see you breathing
I got the windows steaming
I wanna see you breathing

[Chorus]
Howling out your name
Red like champagne
You're gonna feel the vibes
When the wolf comes out tonight
When the wolf comes out tonight
When the wolf comes out tonight
(Can you feel the vibes?)
When the wolf comes out tonight
When the wolf comes out tonight
When the wolf comes out tonight
                        
                    |
