                        Bài hát: Wild Ones - Flo Rida, Sia

Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do

I want to shut down the club
With you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
Oooh

[Flo Rida]
I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping
Music, I might lose it
Blast to the roof, that's how we do'z it
I don't care the night, she don't care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get popping, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jumping no doubts
Surfing the crowd
Oooh
Said I gotta be the man
When they heading my van, might check one too
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose
After bottle, we all get bit and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shuts down, I heard you're super models

[Sia - Hook]
Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do

I want shut down the club
With you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
Oooh

[Flo Rida]
Party rocker, foot show stopper
More shampoo
Never one, club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Til I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Oh, it's on like everything goes
Round up baby til the freaky show

What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show
I like em untamed, don't tell me how pain
Tell them this, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, coming harder than we hit play
Do you busy with the bail, were you insane

[Sia - Hook]
Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do

I want to shut down the club
With you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
Oooh

[Bridge]
I am a wild one
Break me in
Saddle me up and lets begin
I am a wild one
Tame me now
Running with wolves
And i'm on the prowl

Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tell that body
Gotta make sure do you have enough
I can't lie
The wilds don't lie

[Sia - Hook]
Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do

I want to shut down the club
With you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
Oooh

I am a wild one
Break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one
Tame me now
Running with wolves
And i'm on the prowl....
