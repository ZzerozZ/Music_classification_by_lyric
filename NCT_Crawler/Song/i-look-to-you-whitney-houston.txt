Whitney Houston - I Look To You

As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all

Winter's storm has come
And darkened my sun
After all that we’ve been through
Who on earth can I turn to

I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can strong
I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you

About to lose my breathe
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door

And every road that I've taken
Lead to my regret
And I don't know if I'm going to make it
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you

My levees are broken
My walls have come
Tumbling down on me

The rain is falling
Defeat is calling
I need you to set me free

Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me

I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you

I look to you
I look to you
