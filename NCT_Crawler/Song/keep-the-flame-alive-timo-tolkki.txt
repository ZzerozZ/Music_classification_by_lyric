Âu Mỹ khác|

                        I have walked this lonely road
A thousand years, it's filled with bitter tears
I have swum across the sea
Just to find I have no home

I have been everywhere
I have seen what I should not have seen
Still I'm here on this same road
Trying to find where is my home

In my heart in my soul
Weariness tears apart
Still i walk on this road but you, my friends...
keep the flame alive...
                        
                    |
