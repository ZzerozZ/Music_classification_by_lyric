                        Bài hát: The Remedy For A Broken Heart (Why Am I So In Love) - Xxxtentacion

Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that a blood bitch may frame

My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a
Headed to the islands ASAP 
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feeling like ET, flying out of the Addy

*** on shawty, she baddie
'Cause she was calming the addict
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lying
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grape vine

Heard shawty still in love through the grape vine
Heard shawty in love through the grape vine
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al-, we gon' be al-
We gon' be al-, we gon' be al-
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash

With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al-, we gon' be alright
We gon' be al-, we gon' be al-
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al-, we gon' be al-
We gon' be alright, we gon' be al-
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that

We gon' be al-, we gon' be al-
We gon' be al-, we gon' be al-
Why am I so in love?
I dont know why
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
She said I, oh, I, am falling for you, falling for you
I, oh, I, am falling for you, falling for you

I, oh, I, am falling for you, falling for you
I, oh, I, am falling for you, falling for you
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
