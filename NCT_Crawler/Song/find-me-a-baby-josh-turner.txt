                        Bài hát: Find Me A Baby - Josh Turner

I was sitting on a creek bank, bored out of my mind
Casting away a day, a week, a month of my whole life
And then it hit me like a ten pound catfish upside my head
Nothings worth doing if Im doing it all by myself
I need to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I need to share all Ive got and put a couple more trains on this old track
This singing solos gettin so old to me
Gonna find me a baby and make a couple babies and sing in harmony
Well sing na-nana na-nana na-nana-nana
Na-nana na-nana na-nana-nana
I was sitting on my front porch when she came walking by
And she was looking for a helping hand, a man to change a tire
We hit it off and we talked forever and I bought that girl a ring
Then quicker than a Richard Petty pitstop I got down on one knee
And said I need to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I need to share all Ive got and put a couple more trains on this old track
This singing solos gettin so old to me
Yeah, I found you, baby, lets make a few babies and sing in harmony
Well now, me and my baby are on baby number three
When we all get warmed you oughta hear us sing
Na-nana na-nana na-nana-nana
Na-nana na-nana na-nana-nana
I needed to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I needed to share all Ive got and put a couple more trains on this old track
That singing solo got so old to me
Yeah, I found me a baby, weve made a few babies and we sing in harmony
Yeah, I found me a baby, weve made a few babies and you oughta hear us sing
We go na-nana na-nana na-nana-nana
Na-nana na-nana na-nana-nana
Na-nana na-nana na-nana-nana
Na-nana na-nana na-nana-nana
