                        Way back in the hills
 There's a ploace I know
 People comes from miles around
 Just to watch 'ol Dooley do the show Ooh let the blueboy play
 Ooh let the blueboy play
 Gonna ride the mule
 Gonna chase him too
 Pullin' on-a pullin' on-a
 Pullin' on-a pony
 He goes... Soon's the sun go down
 That's when the fun begins
 Hitch your wagon down the track
 Up to the roadhouse
 And come on in Ooh let the blueboy play
 Ooh let the blueboy play
 Gonna ride the mule
 Gonna chase him too
 Pullin' on-a pullin' on-a
 Pullin' on-a pony
 He goes... Instrumental Sheriff says it late
 Closin' time we got to go
 But Dooley he don't want to quit
 Ain't nobody feels like goin' home Ooh let the blueboy play
 Ooh let the blueboy play
 Gonna ride the mule
 Gonna chase him too
 Pullin' on-a pullin' on-a
 Pullin' on-a pony
 He goes...
