                        Bài hát: Sealed With A Kiss - Brian Hyland

For the summer 
Darling, I promise you this 
I'll send you all my love 
Everyday in a letter 
Sealed with a kiss 

CHORUS: 
Yes it's gonna be cold, lonely summer 
But I'll fill the emptiness 
I'll send you all my dreams 
Everyday in a letter 
Sealed with a kiss 

I'll see you in the sunlight 
I'll hear your voice everywhere 
I'll run to tenderly hold you 
But, Darlin' you won't be there 

I don't wanna say good-bye 
For the summer 
Knowing the love we'll miss 
Let us make a pledge 
To meet in September 
And seal it with a kiss 

(instrumental) 

(CHORUS) 
Sealed with a kiss 
Sealed with a kiss
                        
                    |
