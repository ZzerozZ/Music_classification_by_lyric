                        Bài hát: Savages - Marina and the Diamonds

Murder lives forever
And so does war
It's survival of the fittest
Rich against the poor
At the end of the day
It's a human trait
Sewn deep down inside of our dna

One man can build a bomb
Another run a race
To save somebody's life
And have it blow up in his face
I'm not the only one who
Finds it hard to understand
I'm not afraid of god
I am afraid of man
Is it running in our blood
Is it running in our veins
Is it running in our genes
Is it in our dna
Humans aren't gonna behave
As we think we always should
Yeah, we can bad as we can good

Underneath it all we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We're just animals still learning how to crawl
We live, we die
We steal, we kill, we lie
Just like animals
But with far less grace
We laugh, we cry
Like babies in the night
Forever running wild
In the human race
Another day, another tale of rape
Another ticking bomb to bury deep and detonate
I'm not the only one who finds it hard to understand
I'm not afraid of god
I'm afraid of man
You can see it on the news
You can watch it on tv
You can read it on your phone
You can say it's troubling
Humana aren't gonna behave as we think we always should
Yeah, we can be bad as we can good

Underneath it all we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We're just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
We're just animals still learning to bahave
All the hate coming out from a generation
Who got everything + nothing guided by temptation
Were we born to abuse, shoot a gun + run
Or has something deep inside us come undone?
Is it a human trait or is it learned behaviour
Are you killing for yourself or killing for your saviour?
