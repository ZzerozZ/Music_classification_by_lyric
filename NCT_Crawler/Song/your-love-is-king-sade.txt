                        Bài hát: Your Love Is King - Sade

Your love is king, crown you in my heart
Your love is king, never need to part
Your kisses ring, round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me, I'm crying out for more

Your love is king, crown you in my heart
Your love is king, you're the ruler of my heart
Your kisses ring, round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
I'm crying out for more, your love is king

I'm coming on, I'm coming
You're making me dance, inside

Your love is king, crown you in my heart
Your love is king, never need to part
Your kisses ring, round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me, I'm crying out for more

Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
I'm crying out for more, your love is king
This is no blind faith, this is no sad and sorry dream
This is no blind faith, your love, your love is real

Gotta crown me with your heart
(Your love is king)
Never, never need to part
(Your love is king)
Touch me
(Your love is king)

Never letting go
(Your love is king)
(Your love is king)
Never letting go of your love
(Your love is king)
Never gonna give it up
(Your love is king)

I'm coming
(Your love is king)
Making me dance
