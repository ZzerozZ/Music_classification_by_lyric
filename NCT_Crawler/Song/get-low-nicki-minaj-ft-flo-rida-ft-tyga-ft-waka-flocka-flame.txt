[Verse 1: Waka FLocka]

Oooh, she's just my type (Flocka)
Hair long and her eyes light
Her smile shine like the sunlight
One of a kind, baby momma type
Friend muggin, she the hater type
Waka Flocka, I'm the player type (Flex)
Jewelry bright, winter white
Champagne chilled on ice
Hold up!
Every bad bitch in the club to the dance floor
Hands on your hips, get real low
Throwing money, my M.O
So slot me your info
Let me know, what you doing tonight girl
I ain't got time for no games
I'm only here for tonight girl

Lemme see you get low, low, low
To the floor floor floor
Grab your hips girl

Gimme some more more more

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]

Ride for him
Cause he say I ride real good
Pop star, but I * him like I'm still hood
Heard he wanna spend money on a red bitch
Wanna see me do tricks with the next chick
Anyway, boobs up and my ass out
Somebody get a medic when he pass out
Big Nicki in the game nigga
Bricksquad, I ain't *ing with no lame nigga (ahhh)
Dis dat part when I slow it down like this (ahhh)
Somebody better get da bitch another round (ahhh)
Fly as * I need a co-pilot
When I come out it's a mother *ing ho riot

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyga]

They your size, little waist don't match your thighs
Say you're on my level but my level too high
Looking in your eyes, don't look so surprised
I know you ain't heard that, before
Searching in the club and I just found one
Pick up lines, I just dropped mine
Single for the night, tryna double my fun
So whats up, to the bad bitch
In the corner, with her ass big
And her hair long, I'mma grab it
She call me daddy, but I'm a *
Like, I ain't tryna be horse & carriage
Or tryna take care of you, so put your bad habit
I just wanna smash it, smash it
Pass it, show you where the cash is, cash is
But first lemme see you...

[Extended Hook: Flo Rida]

Lemme see you
Get it low, to the floor
Lemme know, whats up with us
Get it on
I wanna get you home
