                        Bài hát : Only Love - Ben Howard

Darling you're with me, always around me.
Only love, only love.
Darling I feel you, under my body.
Only love, only love.
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on love, come on love.
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart.

And I'll be yours to keep.
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep.
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep.

Darling you're with me, always around me.
Only love, only love.
Darling I feel you, under my body.
Only love, only love.
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on love, come on love.
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart.

And I'll be yours to keep.
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep.
A wind in the shadow, a whale song...

Darling you're with me, always around me.
Only love, only love.
Darling I feel you, under my body.
Only love, only love.
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on love, come on love.
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart.

Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart,
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart,
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart,

Only love love love,
Only love love love,
Only love love love,
Girl show me heart.
Come on love love love,
Come on love love love,
Come on love love love.
Watch me fall apart.
Come on love love love,
Come on love love love,
Come on love love love.
Girl show me heart.
Show me love love love,
Show me love love love,
Show me love love love.
Watch me fall apart.

Darling I feel you, under my body
Darling you're with me, forever and always.
Give me shelter or show me heart.
And watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart.
