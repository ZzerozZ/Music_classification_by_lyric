                        Bài hát: Legends Never Die - Nightcore

Legends never die when the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die, they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
They never lose hope when everything's cold

And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones
They run into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause
Legends never die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?

Legends never die, they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
Hey're written down in eternity

But you'll never see the price it costs – the scars collected all their lives
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause
                        
                    |
