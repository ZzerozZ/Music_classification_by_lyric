                        Bài hát: Only - Nicki Minaj, Drake, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I never fu-cked Wayne, I never fu-cked Drake
On my life, man, fu-ck's sake
If I did I menage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a set up for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt's fake
Worry 'bout yall niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fu-ck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut one, hut two, big bitties, big butt too
Fu-ck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fu-ck with, mad bitches we don't fu-ck with
I don't fu-ck with them chickens unless they last name is cutlet
Let it soak in like seasonin'
And tell 'em, tell 'em blow me, Lance Stephenson

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
I never fu-cked Nicki cause she got a man
But when that's over then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, lowkey it may be high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fu-ck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this *** quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fu-ck with you
The NBA players fu-ck with you
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fu-ck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fu-ck
Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it


[Hook]
Raise your bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of july
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Richest niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
I never fu-cked Nicki and that's fu-cked up
If I did fu-ck she'd be fu-cked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like gold is yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Holly Groove, the holy Mecca
Calender say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet not fu-ck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This is just crazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang take the B out behavior, my nigga
Fu-cking for reals if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Now you see me, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from poor me
To police pour me a drink and celebrate with me

[Hook]
Raise your bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of july
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Richest niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
