                        Bài hát: Summer kisses winter tear - Elvis Presley

Summer kisses, Winter tears 
That was what she gave to me 
Never thought that I'd travel all alone 
With dreams of memories 

Happy hours, lonely years 
But I guess I can't complain 
For I still recall the Summer sun 
Through all the Winter rain 

The fire of love, the fire of love 
Can burn from afar 
And nothing can light the dark of the night 
Like a falling star 
Summer kisses, Winter tears 
Like the stars they fade away 
Leaving me to spend my lonely nights 
With dreams of yesterday 

The fire of love, the fire of love 
Can burn from afar 
And nothing can light the dark of the night 
Like a falling star 
Summer kisses, Winter tears 
Like the stars they fade away 
Leaving me to spend my lonely nights 
With dreams of yesterday 

Leaving me to spend my lonely nights 
With dreams of yesterday 
Summer kisses, Winter tears
                        
                    |
