                        Bài hát: Oh No - Bring Me The Horizon

You don't have to lie, I know exactly where you've been
Cause you're chewing off my ear while you're chewing on your chin

No we're not on the level, you're just off your face
It's not a state of mind no, your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside but you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in

Don't call it a party cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never get enough
Don't tell me you're happy cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
So be careful what you wish for

Who you tryna fool? You know you're in over your head
Cause you're holding onto heaven but you're hanging by a thread

And we're not on the level, you're just off your face
It's not a state of mind no, your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside but you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in

Don't call it a party cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never get enough
Don't tell me you're happy cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
So be careful what you wish for

Don't call it a party cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never get enough
Don't tell me you're happy cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for

Don't call it a party cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never get enough
Don't tell me you're happy cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for

Don't call it a party cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never get enough
Don't tell me you're happy cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
