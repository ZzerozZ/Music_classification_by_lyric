Leonard Cohen - You Have Loved Enough
I said I’d be your lover.
You laughed at what I said.
I lost my job forever.
I was counted with the dead.
I swept the marble chambers,
But you sent me down below.
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know:
That I am not the one who loves
It’s love that seizes me.
When hatred with his package comes,
You forbid delivery.
And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger,
You whisper, \"You have loved enough,
Now let me be the Lover.\"
And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger,
You whisper, \"You have loved enough,
Now let me be the Lover.\"
I swept the marble chambers,
But you sent me down below.
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know:
That I am not the one who loves
It’s love that chooses me.
When hatred with his package comes,
You forbid delivery.
And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger.
You whisper, \"You have loved enough,
Now let me be the Lover.\"
And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger.
You whisper, \"You have loved enough,
Now let me be the Lover...\"
