                        Bài hát: Coconut Tree - Mohombi, Nicole Scherzinger

I'll always remember 
Our summer in Hawaii
Aloha Nui Loa

Under the coconut tree we stay
Fall and crush into me like a wave
You bring the fool out my cool
Baby, use your tools
Make me wanna change my ways

Under the coconut tree,
You be chilling with me
Making love to you in a Bedford room
Made of sand and sea

No place I'd rather be
No one else I wanna please
No one but you, boo I got you
Got the best of me

Hey, hey
Usually I'll be gone before the morning light
Oh, oh but your eyes keep telling me it's not the case tonight

You gon' make me stay
Gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay
Forever
You gon' make me stay
Gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay
Forever

Under the coconut tree we stay
Watch as the night turns into day
We let the fire be the light
Sky's the floor tonight
Fly me with your gentle sway

Under the coconut tree,
You be chilling with me
Making love to you in a Bedford room
Made of sand and sea

No place I'd rather be
No one else I wanna please
No one but you,
Boo I got you, got the best of me

Hey, hey
Usually I'll be gone before the morning light
Oh, oh but your eyes keep telling me it's not the case tonight

You gon' make me stay
Gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay 
Forever
You gon' make me stay
Gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay
Forever

Sing it to me baby, that melody
While I hit the drums
You gon' make me stay
Let me sing, we gon' let it play
Let me play, baby, turn it up, up
You sound just like love
You gon' make me stay, make me stay
We gon get away, get away
Baby, turn it up, up
You sound just like love
Just like love

Hey, hey
Usually I'll be gone before the morning light
Oh, oh but your eyes keep telling me it's not the case tonight

You gon' make me stay
Gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay 
Forever
You gon' make me stay
Gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay
Forever

Hey, hey
Usually I'll be gone before the morning light
Oh, oh but your eyes keep telling me it's not the case tonight

You gon' make me stay
Gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay 
Forever
You gon' make me stay
Gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay
Forever

I'll always remember 
Our summer in Hawaii
Aloha Nui Loa
