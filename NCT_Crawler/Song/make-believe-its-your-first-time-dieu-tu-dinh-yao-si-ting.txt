Âu Mỹ khác|

                        We've tried our hand at love before
We've been around the game enough to know the score'
But then is then and now is now
And now is all that matters anyhow

Make believe it's your first time
Leave your sadness behind
Make believe it's your first time
And I'll make believe it's mine

Well the door is closed, it's you and me
We'll take our time with love the way it oughta be
This moment's ours tonight's the night
And if we fall in love well, that's alright

Make believe it's your first time
Leave your sadness behind
Make believe it's your first time
And I'll make believe it's mine

So close your eyes and hold me close
Let our hearts pretend
That love is ours to share tonight
And it might never end

Make believe it's your first time
Leave your sadness behind
Make believe it's your first time
And I'll make believe it's mine

Make believe it's your first time
And I'll make believe it's mine
                        
                    |
