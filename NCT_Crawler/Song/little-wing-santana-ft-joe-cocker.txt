                        Well, she's walking through the clouds
 With a circus mind,
 That's running wild.
 Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
 And fairytales, That's all she ever thinks about ... Riding with the wind. When I'm sad, she comes to me
 With a thousand smiles
 She gives to me free. It's alright, she says,
 It's alright;
 Take anything you want from me,
 Anything. Fly on, little wing.
