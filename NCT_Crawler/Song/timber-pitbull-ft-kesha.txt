                        Bài hát: Timber - Pitbull, Ke$ha

[Ke$ha]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget

[Pitbull]
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boys are diggity out
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking on a roseton, timber
Crazy town, booty on, timber
That's the way we like the war, timber
I'm sticking it in oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will, timber

Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down

[Ke$ha]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget

It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget

[Pitbull]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
No, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on plane
Left to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumping like it going down, bowl it
Order me another round, homie
We about to climb, wild, 'cause it's about to go down

Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down

[Ke$ha]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget

It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
