                        Bài hát: Memory - Đức Tuấn

Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone.

In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet.

And the wind begins to moan
Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile happy your days 
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time 
I knew what happiness was.

Let the memory live again
Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters 
And the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning.

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustnt give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin.

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The still cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies ,
Another night is over
Another day is dawning.

Touch me,
It is so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me,
You''ll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day 
Has begun.
