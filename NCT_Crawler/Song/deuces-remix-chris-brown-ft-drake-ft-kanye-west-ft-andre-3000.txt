                        What you mean I ain't call you?
 I hit you when I landed
 I'm waiting in my hotel room
 Seems like we are arguing more and it's getting less romantic
 Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
 But I f-cked you right I will
 I f-cked you right I will
 I'll f-ck you like no-one has ever ever made you feel
 I mean it's part of our relationships, amazing still
 I might just put up with the arguing and stay for real
 You looking mad, girl for goodness sakes
 You with all those curves and me without no breaks
 Ooh, I'm willing to work it out however long it takes you
 You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
 Our timing is wrong
 Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
 Yeah but tell them b-tches that you'll always be my missus
 And the hardest part about the f-cking business is minding your own
 Uhh, and everytime I try and break it off
 We just yell until we tired then I break you off
 It's useless all this fighting lets get past it now
 Even when I throw them deuces you just send it back around
