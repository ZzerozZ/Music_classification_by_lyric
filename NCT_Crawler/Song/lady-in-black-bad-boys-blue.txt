                        Deserted place and so far from home
 I was alone, I was all on my own
 The moon was shining, I saw her face
 A magic woman all dressed in a lace She gave me a sign and I followed her
 To a house of light somewhere in the night Behind the window the symbols of red
 Painting the face of the lady in black
 Behind the window I'll never forget
 The magic lady, the lady in black
 She'll never come back The lady's beauty was so divine
 She took my heart with her heavenly smile
 When I reached out just to kiss her hand
 I suddenly tumbled down in the sand There was broken lace lying on the ground
 And the house of light was fading in the night Behind the window the symbols of red
 Painting the face of the lady in black
 Behind the window I'll never forget
 The magic lady, the lady in black There was broken lace lying on the ground
 And the house of light was fading in the night Behind the window the symbols of red
 Painting the face of the lady in black
 Behind the window I'll never forget
 The magic lady, the lady in black Behind the window the symbols of red
 Painting the face of the lady in black
 Behind the window I'll never forget
 The magic lady, the lady in black The lady in black
 The lady in black
