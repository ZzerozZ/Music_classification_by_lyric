                        Bài hát: Somebody Else - The 1975

So I heard you found somebody else
And at first I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
Oh, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

Come on baby
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
Come on baby
You said you'd find someone to take my place

Oh I just don't believe that you have got it in you cause
We are just gonna keep 'doin' it' and everytime
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be getting over it

I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
Oh, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
*** that
Get Money
I can't give you my soul
Cause we're never alone
[x4]

I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
Oh, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else
                        
                    |
