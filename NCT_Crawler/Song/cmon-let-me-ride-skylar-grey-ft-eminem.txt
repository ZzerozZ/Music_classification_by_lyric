                        And the wheels go round, and round, and round If you got a sweet tooth,
 You can taste my watermelons
 If a swing set bores you
 I can show you all my talent
 I can wear a tan like other bitches can
 You can have all this, boy!
 And there's only one thing that I want from you C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
 It's so fantastical on your bicycle
 We can get a little more physical
 Baby, after all, it's only natural
 I feel it coming, coming, coming, oh
 Feel it running, running, running, oh oh
 C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
 It's so fantastical on your bicycle You want to ride my bicycle
 You want to ride my bike (ha ha) If the world starts freezing, I can make it hot and humid
 If you get a bee-sting, I can suck out all the poison
 I can make you last like all the bitches can't
 Have I made it clear, boy?
 There's only one thing that I want from you, hey! C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
 It's so fantastical on your bicycle
 We can get a little more physical
 Baby, after all, it's only natural
 I feel it coming, coming, coming, oh
 Feel it running, running, running, oh
 C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
 It's so fantastical, on your bicycle I'm only *** with you
 *** you for thinking it's true
 I'm not like the sluts in this town
 They make me blah in my mouth
 I wanna ride on your bike
 'Cause you're the boy that I like
 It's like I'm a sell out for you
 But your bike's so shiny and new (shiny and new) She's distracted by my reflectors, man, I can tell the chick's attracted
 My wheels spoke to her, my Swinn is a chick magnet
 Bagging up chicks like a bag of chips
 With a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips
 Shagging's something I'm a pro at, but I ain't practicing ***
 Allen Iverson has safe sex, condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice
 Flip backwards while I flip this bike on it's banana seat
 My fantasy's to have you land where the kick stand is
 Got this bitch gagging, they call me the broad killer
 I'm the cousin of Godzilla
 'Cause I spit fire and my dick is draggin'
 Zig-zaggin' up the avenue, pulling these chicks in my antagonist wagon, screamin' C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
 It's so fantastical on your bicycle
 We can get a little more physical
 Baby, after all, it's only natural
 I feel it coming, coming, coming, oh
 Feel it running, running, running, oh
 C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
 It's so fantastical on your bicycle You want to ride my bicycle
 You want to ride my bike (ha ha)
 You want to ride my bicycle
 You want to ride my bike (ha ha)
