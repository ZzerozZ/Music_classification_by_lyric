                        Bài hát: Wake Up With Me - Gabrielle Aplin

It's hard to make a change
Think of all the lies that we've been told
Everything we have can all be gone before you know
And all I wanna say
Is that we've been asleep for far too long
I hope that we can find another place to belong
So don't go
Come close

And wake up with me
Open up your eyes
Breath easy
You and I can make our escape
And give the pain to yesterday
Feel a fresher light on your face

Remember when we thought
Anything would happen if we tried
Remember when the world was just as big on the inside
But friends with vacant eyes
And cynics with a smile
Change you 'til your world was undermined
So don't go
Come close

And wake up with me
Open up your eyes
Breath easy
You and I can make our escape
And give the pain to yesterday
Feel a fresher light on your face

You and I can make our escape
And give the pain to yesterday
Feel a fresher light on your face
                        
                    |
