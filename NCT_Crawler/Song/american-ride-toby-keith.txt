                        Winter gettin' colder, summer gettin' warmer
 Tidal wave comin' cross the Mexican border
 Why buy a gallon, it's cheaper by the barrel
 Just don't get busted singin' Christmas carols That's us, that's right
 Gotta love this American ride
 Both ends of the ozone burnin'
 Funny how the world keeps turning
 Look ma, no hands
 I love, this American ride
 Gotta love this American ride Momma gets her rocks off watchin' Desperate Housewives
 Daddy works his ass off payin' for the good life
 Kids on the YouTube learnin' how to be cool
 Livin' in a cruel world, it pays to be a mean girl That's us, that's right
 Gotta love this American ride
 Both ends of the ozone burnin'
 Funny how the world keeps turning
 Look ma, no hands
 I love, this American ride
 Gotta love this American ride Poor little infa-Miss America's down
 She gained five pounds and lost her crown
 Quick fix plastic surgical antidote
 Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note Plasma gettin' bigger, Jesus gettin' smaller
 Spill a cup of coffee make a million dollars
 Customs got a thug with an aerosol can
 If the shoe don't fit, the fits gonna hit the shan That's us
 That's right
 Gotta love this American ride
 Both ends of the ozone burnin'
 Funny how the world keeps turning
 Hot dog, hot damn
 I love, this American ride
 Gotta love this American ride, oh yeah
