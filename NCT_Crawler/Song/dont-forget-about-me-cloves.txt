                        Bài hát: Don'T Forget About Me - Cloves

[Verse 1]
If I fall, can you pull me up?
Is it true, your watching out
And when I'm tired, do you lay down with me?
In my head so I can sleep without you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey
Without you there's holes in my soul
Hey, hey
Let the water in

[Chorus]
Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me
Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me

[Verse 2]
Lost through time and that's all I need
So much love, then one day buried
Hope you're safe, cause I lay you leaves
Is there more than we can see?
Answers for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And hey, hey
Without you there's holes in my soles
Hey, hey
Let the water in

[Chorus]
Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me
Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me

[Bridge]
And I get lonely without you
And I can't move on
And I get lonely without you
I can't move on
Move on

[Chorus]
Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me
                        
                    |
