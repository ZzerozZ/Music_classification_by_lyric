[Paul:]
Havin' my baby
What a lovely way of sayin'
How much you love me
Havin' my baby
What a lovely way of sayin'
What you're thinkin' of me
I can see it, face is glowin'
I can see in your eyes
I'm happy you know it
[Both:]
That you're havin' my baby
[Paul:]
You're the woman I love
And I love what it's doin' to ya
[Both:]
Havin' my baby
[Paul:]
You're a woman in love
And I love what's goin' through ya
[Paul:]
The need inside you
I see it showin'
Whoa, the seed inside ya
Baby, do you feel it growin'
Are you happy you know it
That you're
[Both:]
Havin' my baby
[Odia:]
I'm a woman in love
And I love what it's doin' to me
[Both:]
Havin' my baby
[Odia:]
I'm a woman in love
And I love what's goin' through me
[Paul:]
Didn't have to keep it
Wouldn't put ya through it
You could have swept it from you life
But you wouldn't do it
No, you wouldn't do it
[Both:]
And you're havin' my baby
[Odia:]
I'm a woman in love
And I love what it's doin' to me
[Both:]
Havin' my baby
[Odia:]
I'm a woman in love
And I love what's goin' through me
[Paul:]
Havin' my baby (havin' my baby)
What a lovely way of sayin'
How much you love me
[Paul:]
Havin' my baby
(havin' my baby)
[Odia:]
I'm a woman in love
And I love what's goin' through me
