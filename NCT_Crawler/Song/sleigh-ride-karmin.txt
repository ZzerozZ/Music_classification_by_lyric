                        Bài hát: Sleigh Ride - Karmin

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap (yeah)
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "yoo-hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, you-hoo-hoo

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
(Twi-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
We're snuggled up together like birds of a feather would be
(Twi-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
(Twi-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, you-hoo-hoo

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
It's grand, just holding your hand
We're riding along to the song of a wintry fairyland

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "yoo-hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, you-hoo-hoo

(Twi-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
(Twi-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
(Twi-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
(Twi-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)

Roo-roo-rooftop we pause, just like the Clause
Noses so red, Poinsettias in a vase
My Pillsbury dough boy, gingerbread tough
Now kiss me did you miss me mistletoe for some luck
The winter ice so cold, yeah it's clogging my snuff
I need the fireplace hot get the logs in the ov'
Until I get my eggnog a-fog foggin' me up
Catch me candy cane crunchin' - come on!

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
(Twi-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
We're snuggled up together like birds of a feather would be
(Twi-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
(Twi-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, you-hoo-hoo

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
