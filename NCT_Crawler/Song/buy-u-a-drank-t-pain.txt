                        Shawty snap, T-Pain
Damn, shawty snap
Yung Joc, shawty snap
Ay, ay, she snappin
Snap ya fingers, do the step
You can do it all by yourself

Oh, baby girl, what's yo' name?
Let me talk to you, lemme buy you a drank
I'm T-Pain, you know me
Konvict Music, Nappy Boy

I know the club, close at three
What's the chances of you rollin' with me?
Back to the crib, show you how I live
Let's get drunk, forget what we did

I'ma buy you a drank
I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty what you think 'bout that
I'll be in the gray Cadillac

We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Talk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I talk that
Crunk juice bottles, Oakley shades
Shawty got class, oh behave

Let's get gone, walk it out
Just like that, that's what I'm talkin 'bout
We gon' have fun, you gon' see
On that Patron you should get like me

I'ma buy you a drank
I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty what you think 'bout that
I'll be in the gray Cadillac

We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Won't you meet me at the bar, respect big pimpin'?
Tell me how you feel mama? Tell me what you sippin'?
A certified dime piece deserve Louis one three
150 a shot, three for you and three for me

I'm checkin' your body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips, I get a tingly sensation
Now we're both 'bout tipsy, you say, you're in the mood
All I need is 'bout an hour, better yet maybe two

Lemme take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in your ear, your legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
I'ma let T-Pain sing, so he can make it clear

I'ma buy you a drank
I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty what you think 'bout that
I'll be in the gray Cadillac

We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Let's get gone, walk it out
Now walk it, think about it, aw, snap
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yourself

Let's get gone, walk it out
Now walk it think about it, aw snap
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yourself

I'ma buy you a drank
I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty what you think 'bout that
I'll be in the gray Cadillac

We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
