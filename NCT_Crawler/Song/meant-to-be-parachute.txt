                        When I found you
 You could run so fast
 You never really wanted love
 And it couldn't really hold you back
 You were that speed train
 And you were still on the run
 Yeah you would crash right in
 And then you'd just move along
 Oh I know that it haunts me
 Wishing you could just stay
 Drive away if you want to
 You can slow down babe
 But you just can't wait Don't you see?
 You can try to fight it
 But it's meant to be
 You and me
 Baby please
 Don't believe
 Anything they tell you
 Right here
 I swear
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be When you fly off
 Yes you get so high
 You never want to come back down
 And you never really had to try
 Baby all I know
 And that I've come to find
 You can the touch the sun
 But you're never gonna kiss the sky
 Oh I know that it haunts you
 Wishing you could be there
 Fly away if you want to
 It's a new view babe
 But it's the same air Don't you see?
 You can try to fight it
 But it's meant to be
 You and me
 Baby please
 Don't believe
 Anything they tell you
 Right here
 I swear
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 Don't you see?
 You can try to fight it
 But it's meant to be
 You and me
 Baby please
 Don't believe
 Anything they tell you
 Right here
 I swear
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
 This is where you're meant to be
