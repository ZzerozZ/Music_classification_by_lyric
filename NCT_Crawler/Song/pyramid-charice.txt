                        Bài hát: Pyramid - Charice

Shawty's love is like a pyramid
We stand together 'til the very end
There'll never be another love for sure
Iyaz and Charice let we go

Stones
Heavy like the love you've shown
Solid as the ground we've known
And I just wanna carry on

We took it from the bottom up
And even in a desert storm
Sturdy as a rock, we hold
Wishing every moment froze

Now I just wanna let you know
Earthquakes can't shake us
Cyclones can't break us
Hurricanes can't take away our love

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top
(At the top, baby)
Like a pyramid

And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall, just keep on going
Forever we will stay
Like a pyramid

Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey
Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey
Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey

Cold, never ever when you're close
We will never let it fold
A story that was never told
Something like a mystery

And every step we took we've grown
Look how fast the time has flown
A journey to a place unknown
We're going down in history

Earthquakes can't shake us
Cyclones can't break us
Hurricanes can't take away our love

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top
(At the top, baby)
Like a pyramid

And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall, just keep it going
Forever we will stay
Like a pyramid

Like a pyramid, girl, lmma show you
That I love you so much, that we gonna get through
Even when it storms, I will never go
Imma be the one to keep you safe, hey

Four walls and love, packin' more than enough
Holding on to one another, be the cover when it's rough
Mother nature or disaster
Won't stop our happy ever after

Pyramid, keep it going
(Like a pyramid, like a pyramid)
Whoa
(Like a pyramid, like a pyramid)

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top
(At the top, baby)
Like a pyramid

And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall, just keep on going
Forever we will stay
Like a pyramid

We built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top
(At the top, baby, at the top)
Like a pyramid

And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall, just keep it going
Forever we will stay
Like a pyramid

Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey
Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, yeah
Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey
                        
                    |
