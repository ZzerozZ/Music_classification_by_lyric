Âu Mỹ khác|

                        I'm malicious, mean and scary
 My sneer could curdle dairy
 And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest
 But despite my evil look
 And my temper and my hook
 I've always yearned to be a concert pianist
 Can't you see me on the stage performin' Mozart
 Ticklin' the ivories 'til they gleam?
 Yep, I'd rather be called deadly
 For my killer show tune medley
 Thank you, 'cause way down deep inside I've got a dream
 He's got a dream
 He's got a dream
 See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem
 Though I do like breaking femurs
 You can count me with the dreamers
 Like everybody else, I've got a dream
 I've got scars and lumps and bruises
 Plus something here that oozes
 And let's not even mention my complexion
 But despite my extra toes
 And my goiter and my nose
 I really wanna make a love connection
 Can't you see me with a special little lady
 Rowin' in a rowboat down the stream?
 Though I'm one disgusting blighter
 I'm a lover, not a fighter
 'Cause way down deep inside, I've got a dream
 I've got a dream
 (He's got a dream)
 I've got a dream
 (He's got a dream)
 And I know one day romance will reign supreme
 Though my face leaves people screaming
 There's a child behind it, dreaming
 Like everybody else, I've got a dream
 Tor would like to quit and be a florist
 Gunther does interior design
 Ulf is into mime, Attila's cupcakes are sublime
 Bruiser knits, killer sews, Fang does little puppet shows
 And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns
 I have dreams like you, no, really
 Just much less touchy-feely
 They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny
 On an island that I own
 Tanned and rested and alone
 Surrounded by enormous piles of money
 I've got a dream
 (She's got a dream)
 I've got a dream
 (She's got a dream)
 I just wanna see the floating lanterns gleam
 Yeah
 And with every passing hour
 I'm so glad I left my tower
 Like all you lovely folks, I've got a dream
 She's got a dream
 He's got a dream
 They've got a dream
 We've got a dream
 So our differences ain't really that extreme
 We're one big team
 Call us brutal
 Sick
 Sadistic
 And grotesquely optimistic
 'Cause way down deep inside, we've got a dream
 I've got a dream
 I've got a dream
 I've got a dream
 I've got a dream
 I've got a dream
 I've got a dream
 Yes, way down deep inside, I've got a dream
 Yeah
