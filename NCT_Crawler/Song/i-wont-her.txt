                        Bài hát: I Won't - H.E.R.

[Verse 1]
If I don't say nothing
What would make you think something
I just wanna chill
I don't wanna feel
But I could see this coming and
I shoulda' known better
I shoulda' known better
Trust me I'm not frontin' if I'm not feelin' ya
Don't give me your feelings yeah

[Chorus]
You can't make me love you If I don't
You can't make me love you if I won't
You can't change my heart, you're tryin' too hard
You can't make me love you no I won't, I won't

[Verse 2]
If I'm not into you
Don't hit me with the interview
Askin' all the questions
You don't have to call
I don't wanna talk
What gave you the impression that I would be down?
Really got you down
Shoulda' known better
Cause I'm not feelin' ya
Don't get in your feelings yeah

[Chorus]
You can't make me love you If I don't
You can't make me love you if I won't
You can't change my heart, you're tryin' too hard
You can't make me love you no I won't, I won't
I won't, no I, no I won't
I won't

[Bridge]
Baby I don't beat around the bush
Makin' this more than what it should be
Actin' like you misunderstood me
I don't understand it, I don't understand it
Why you gotta push me to the edge for?
Makin' this more than what it is, oh
You ain't just tryna be friends
Tryna give me the world when I'm on another planet
I don't understand it, I don't understand it
Ask me for the feedback, I give it like Janet

[Chorus]
Yeah you can't make me love you
Love you, love you
You can't make me love you If I don't
You can't make me love you if I won't
Yeah, you can't change my heart, you're tryin' too hard
You can't make me love you no I won't, I won't
