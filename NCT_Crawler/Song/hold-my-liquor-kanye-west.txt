                        I can hold my liquor
 What this man can't handle is me
 Dark and lonely now
 On Chicago, south of town
 I'm on to Indiana
 I heard it in the radio now I can't handle no liquor
 But these bitches can't handle me
 I can't control my niggas
 And my niggas they can't control me
 You say you know me, my nigga
 But you really just know the old me Bitch I'm back out my coma
 Waking up on your sofa
 When I park my Range Rover
 Slightly scratch your Corolla
 Okay, I smashed your Corolla
 I'm hanging on a hangover
 Five years we been over
 Ask me why I came over
 One more hit and I can own ya
 One more *** and I can own ya
 One cold night in October
 Pussy had me floating
 Feel like Deepak Chopra
 Pussy had me dead
 Might call 2Pac over
 Yeezy's all on you sofa
 These the red Octobers
 Still ain't learn me no manners
 You love me when I ain't sober
 You love me when I'm hungover
 Even when I blow doja
 Then her auntie came over
 Skinny bitch with no shoulders
 Tellin' you that I'm bogus
 Bitch you don't even know us
 "Baby girl, he's a loner
 Baby girl, he's a loner
 Late night organ donor
 After that he disown ya
 After that he's just hopeless
 Soul mates become soulless
 When he's sober it's over"
 And bitch, I'm back out my coma Callin' up your uncle's place
 ***'s all over the place
 I don't hear your phone
 Oh I wanna phone home I can't handle no liquor
 But these bitches can't handle me
 I can't control my niggas
 And my niggas they can't control me
 You say you know me, my nigga
 But you really just know the old me I heard you need a new fad
 I heard you need a new stack
 I heard you need a new phone
 I know your 'rents ain't be home Callin' up your uncle's place
 ***'s all over the place
 I don't hear your phone
 Oh I wanna phone home
