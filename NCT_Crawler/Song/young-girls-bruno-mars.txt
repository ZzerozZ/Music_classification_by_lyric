                        Bài hát: Young Girls - Bruno Mars

I spent all my money on a big ol' fancy car 
For these bright eyed honeys 
Oh yeah you know who you are 
Keep me up till the sun is high 
Till the birds stop calling my name 
I'm addicted and I don' knowt why 
Guess I've always been this way 
All these roads still be wrong 
But I still drive them all night long, all night long 

All you young wild girls 
You make a mess of me 
Yeah you young wild girls 
You'll be the death of me, the death of me 
All you young wild girls 
No matter what you do 
Yeah you young wild girls 
I'll always come back to you, come back to you 

I get lost under these lights 
I get lost in the words I say 
Stop believing my own lies 
Like everything will be okay 
Oh I still dream of simple life 
Boy means girl makes it this wild 
But love don't exist when you live like this that much I know, yes I know 

All these roads still be wrong 
But I still drive them all night long, all night long 

All you young wild girls 
You make a mess of me 
Yeah you young wild girls 
You'll be the death of me, the death of me 
All you young wild girls 
No matter what you do 
Yeah you young wild girls 
I'll always come back to you, come back to you 

You, you, you, you 
Yeah you you you 
You you you you 

All you young wild girls 
You make a mess of me 
Yeah you young wild girls 
You'll be the death of me, the death of me 
All you young wild girls 
No matter what you do 
Yeah you young wild girls 
I'll always come back to you, come back to you
