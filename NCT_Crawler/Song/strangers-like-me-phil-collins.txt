                        Whatever you do
 I'll do it too
 Show me everything
 And tell me how
 You know me something
 And yet nothing to me
 I can see there is too much to learn
 It's all so close
 And yet so far
 I see myself
 As people see me
 But I just know there's something bigger out there I want to know, can you show me
 I want to know about the strangers like me
 Tell me more, please show me
 Something's familiar
 About the strangers like me Every gesture
 Every move that she makes
 Makes me feel like never before
 Why do I have this growing need to be beside her
 There are some emotions that I never knew
 Some for the world far beyond this place
 Beyond the trees, above the clouds
 I see before me a new horizon I want to know, can you show me?
 I want to know about the strangers like me
 Tell me more, please show me
 Something is familiar
 About the strangers like me Come with me now
 To see my world
 Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
 Can you feel the things I feel right now with you
 Take my hand
 There's a world I need to know I want to know, can you show me?
 I want to know about the strangers like me
 Tell me more, please show me
 Something is familiar
 About the strangers like me I want to know
