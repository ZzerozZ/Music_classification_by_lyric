Fallen Embers

Language: English
Once, as my heart remember,
All the stars were fallen embers.
Once, when night seemed forever
I was with you.
Once, in the care of morning
In the air was all belonging.
Once, when that day was dawning.
I was with you.
How far we are from morning.
How far are we
And the stars shining through the darkness,
Falling in the air.
Once, as the night was leaving
Into us our dreams were worth keeping.
Once, all dreams were worth keeping.
I was with you.
Once, when our hearts were singing,
I was with you.
