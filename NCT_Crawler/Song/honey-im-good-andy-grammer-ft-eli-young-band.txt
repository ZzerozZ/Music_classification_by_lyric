                        Bài hát: Honey, I'm Good. - Andy Grammer, Eli Young Band

Nah nah honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home

[Verse 1:]
It’s been a long night here, and a long night there
And these long long legs are damn near everywhere
(hold up now)
You look good, I will not lie
But if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I gotta be like oh, baby, no, baby, you got me all wrong, baby
My baby’s already got all of my love

[Chorus:]
So nah nah honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home,
And if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu
To another I will stay true
(ooh ooh I will stay true)
(ooh ooh I will stay true)

[Verse 2:]
Now better men, than me have failed
Drinking from that unholy grail
(Now check it out)
I got her, and she got me
And you’ve got that ass, but I kindly
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, baby, you got me all wrong, baby
My baby’s already got all of my love

[Chorus:]
So nah nah honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home,
And if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu
To another I will stay true
(ooh ooh I will stay true)
(ooh ooh I will stay true)

[Bridge:]
Oh, I’m sure ya, sure ya will make somebody’s night
But, oh, I assure ya, assure ya, it sure as hell's not mine

Oh, no, honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home
And if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu
To another I will stay true

[Chorus:]
No, no, honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home
And if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu
To another I will stay true
True ooo, ooo

[4x]
I will stay true

[4x]
Sing it now
Oh whoa oh

I will stay true
                        
                    |
