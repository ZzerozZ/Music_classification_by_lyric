                        Bài hát: Hey - Fais, Afrojack

[Verse 1]
I seen the look in your face
Telling me a story
You don't have to be alone
I love to see you smiling
Why you try to hide it?
Don't you know you've got it all?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know when you're gone
You do your thing
And you live like you want
I know when you're gone
You're just looking for a little sign of love

[Chorus]
I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I say hey-ey, hey-ey
I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey

[Instrumental break: 8 measures]

[Verse 2]
See the way you moving
No need for introducing
You're everything a man could want
You and I, we both know
Only one with this course
Baby let me take you home

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know when you're gone
You do your thing
And you live like you want
I know when you're gone
All you're looking for is a little sign of love

[Chorus]
I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I say hey-ey, hey-ey
I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey

[Instrumental break: 8 measures]

[Bridge: Acoustic Chorus]
I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I say hey-ey, hey-ey
I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey

[Chorus]
I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I say hey-ey, hey-ey
I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I said hey-ey, hey-ey
                        
                    |
