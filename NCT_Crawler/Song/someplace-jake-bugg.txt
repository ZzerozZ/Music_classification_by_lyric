                        Bài hát: Someplace - Jake Bugg

It goes like the clouds
It floats like the sky
I want to go someplace and find you there.

Don't go away
I need you to stay
I want to go someplace and find you there.

And, yes, you just run to him
And I'll be down on my knees begging you,
Begging you: Don't! I love you.

I saw through your lies
I saw through your disguise
I want to go someplace and find you there.

And, yes, you just run to him
And I'll be down on my knees begging you,
Begging you: Don't! I love you.

Don't go away,
I need you to stay.
I want to go someplace and find you there!
I want to go someplace and find you there.
