                        A lot of people ask me, stupid ***in' questions
 A lot of people think that, what I say on record
 Or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life
 Or that I believe in it
 Or if I say that, I want to kill somebody, that
 I'm actually gonna do it
 Or that I believe in it
 Well, ***, if you believe that
 Then I'll kill you
 You know why? Cause I'm a criminal!
 Criminal
 You god damn right
 I'm a criminal
 Yeah, I'm a criminal My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
 That will stab you in the head
 Whether you're a fag or les'
 Or the homo-sex, hermaph', or a trans'a'vest'
 Pants or dress, hate fags? the answer's "yes"
 Homophobic? nah, you're just hetero phobic
 Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (ooh!)
 That's my mother***in' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
 They belong in my scrotum
 You'll never get hold of 'em
 Hey, it's me, versace
 Whoops, somebody shot me!
 And I was just checkin' the mail
 Get it? checkin' the 'male'?
 How many records you expectin' to sell
 After your second l.p sends you directly to jail?
 Come on! relax guy, I like gay men
 Right, ken? give me an amen (amen!)
 Please lord, this boy needs jesus
 Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
 Oh, and please send me a brand new car
 And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
 Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
 You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
 You can't teach me a *** thing 'cause
 I watch t.v, and comcast cable
 And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
 You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
 And you can't stop me from droppin' each march
 With a brand new c-d for these ***in' retards
 Duh, and to think, it's just little ol' me
 Mr. "don't give a ***," still won't leave [chorus: x2]
 I'm a criminal
 Cause every time I write a rhyme
 These people think it's a crime
 To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
 But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
 And keep goin', I don't take *** from no one My mother did drugs, tar, liquor, cigarettes, and speed
 The baby came out, disfigured, ligaments indeed
 It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
 Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
 I'm a criminal
 An animal caged who turned crazed
 But how the *** you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
 So as I got older and I got a lot taller
 My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
 I drink more liquor to *** you up quicker
 Than you'd want to *** me up for sayin' the word
 My morals went, when the president got oral
 Sex in his oval office on top of his desk
 Off of his own employee
 Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
 You can't miss me, I'm white, blond-haired
 And my nose is pointy
 I'm the bad guy, who makes fun of people that die
 In plane crashes and laughs
 As long as it ain't happened to him
 Slim shady, I'm as crazy as em-
 Inem and kim combined the maniac's in
 Replacin' the doctor cause dre couldn't make it today
 He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
 (mm-mm-mm!) oh, that's dre with an a.k to his face
 Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
 I told you dre, you should've kept that thing put away
 I guess that will teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
 I'm a criminal
 Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that mother***er
 Get the mother***in' money and get the *** up outta there Aight
 I'll be right here waitin' on you
 Aight
 Yo 'em
 What?
 Don't kill nobody this time Aw'right, god damn, ***
 How you doin'?
 Hi, how can I help you?
 Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
 Okay
 Put the ***in' money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you! What? oh my god, don't kill me
 I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around
 Don't kill me, please don't kill me
 I said I'm not gonna ***in' kill you
 Hurry the *** up! Thank you!
 Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
 So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
 So I'll be disguised in it
 And if anybody identifies the guy in it
 I'll hide for five minutes
 Come back, shoot the eyewitness
 Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
 Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
 This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
 If I ever gave a ***, I'd shave my nuts
 Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
 You mother***in' chickens ain't brave enough
 To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
 ***, half the *** I say, I just make it up
 To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
 And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
 I'm a be a ***in' rapist in a jason mask [chorus: x2]
