                        Bài hát: In The Arms Of A Stranger (Grey Remix) - Mike Posner

I was 16 with a rocket
And some sunshine in my pocket
It was how you used words I didn't know
And the way you said my name
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes
Little flame that we pretend doesn't glow

You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

There were times I think about us
Overcome by the nostalgias
I am on call when you need me, let me know
But we're drifting in a strange way
I'm aware that it's mistake if I love you
It's a mistake if I don't

You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

And she smelled like Michigan
And it felt like lust
And the nostalgia's killing me
And it's all because

I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, stranger, stranger
I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
                        
                    |
