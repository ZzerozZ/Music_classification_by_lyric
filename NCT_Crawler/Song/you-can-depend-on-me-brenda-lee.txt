                        Though you say, "We're through"
 I'll always love you
 And you can depend on me Though someone that you've met
 Has made you forget
 Honey you know, you can count on me When I wish, I wish you success
 And loads, loads of happiness
 But baby, I gotta confess, I'll be lonely If you ever, if you ever need a friend
 I'll be yours until the end
 And you can depend on me I wish you success and loads of happiness
 But darling, I gotta confess
 I'm gonna be lonely Oh if you ever, if you ever need a friend
 I'll be right by your side until the end
 And you can depend on me
 You can depend on me
