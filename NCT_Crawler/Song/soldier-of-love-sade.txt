                        I've lost the use of my heart
 But I'm still alive
 Still looking for the life
 The endless pool on the other side
 It's a wild wild west
 I'm doing my best I'm at the borderline of my faith,
 I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
 In the frontline of this battle of mine
 But I'm still alive I'm a soldier of love.
 Every day and night
 I'm soldier of love
 All the days of my life I've been torn up inside (oh!)
 I've been left behind (oh!)
 So I ride
 I have the will to survive In the wild wild west,
 Trying my hardest
 Doing my best
 To stay alive I am love's soldier! I wait for the sound
 (oooh oohhh) I know that love will come (that love will come)
 Turn it all around I'm a soldier of love (soldier of love)
 Every day and night
 I'm a soldier of love
 All the days of my life I am lost
 but I don't doubt (oh!)
 So I ride
 I have the will to survive In the wild wild west,
 Trying my hardest
 Doing my best
 To stay alive I am love's soldier! I wait for the sound I know that love will come
 I know that love will come
 Turn it all around I'm a soldier of love
 I'm a soldier Still waiting for love to come
 Turn it all around
 (4x) I'm a soldier of love
 I'm a soldier Still waiting for love to come
 Turn it all around
 (3x) Still waiting for love to come
