                        Bài hát: The Good, The Bad & The Crazy - Imany

There's a whole lot of women in me
You're wondering what I mean, I see
Meet the Good, the Bad and the Crazy
I come in many shades and shapes
So don't put up the barricades
I'm not here to make a war

I get crazy sometimes
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
Nothing can bring me down
Or keep me sound
I won't get home on time

There's no need for you to follow me
I don't need a chaperone you see
Sanity has gone down the drain
I won't apologize to you
I don't know what I want it's true
Believe I'll still be fine

I get crazy sometimes
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
Nothing can bring me down
Or keep me sound
I won't get home on time

But I get crazy sometimes
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
Nothing can bring me down
Or keep me sound
I won't get home on time

Heads up
Close your eyes
Feel the rain and loose your hair
Swing your hips from the right to the left
You're free to own yourself

But I get crazy sometimes
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
Nothing can bring me down
Or keep me sound
I won't get home on time

But I get crazy sometimes
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
Nothing can bring me down
Or keep me sound
I won't get home on time

But I get crazy sometimes
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
Nothing can bring me down
Or keep me sound
I won't get home on time

But I get crazy sometimes
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
Nothing can bring me down
Or keep me sound
I won't get home on time

On time
