                        Bài hát: These Flowers - Claire Lynch

I wanted to make a good impression on this date
So I stopped off and picked these out myself
But I hope you understand that this package in my hand
Is actually meant for someone else

These flowers ain't for you
They're for your momma
Later on I got something for you too
These flowers ain't for you
They're for you momma
To thank her for havin'
A good lookin' sweet young thing like you

You don't have to ask, I admit that in my past
I ain't been the type that mommas like
But this time what I need is you forever lovin' me
So I'm doing all I can to do things right

These flowers ain't for you
They're for your momma
Later on I got something for you too
These flowers ain't for you
They're for you momma
To thank her for havin'
A girl of my sweet dreams
A good lookin' sweet young thing like you

You mean so much to me
I'd do anything to get to you
I want your family 
To all side up with me from the start
When I ask you for your heart

These flowers ain't for you
They're for your momma
Later on I got something for you too
These flowers ain't for you
They're for you momma
To thank her for havin'
A girl of my sweet dreams
A good lookin' sweet young thing like you
To thank her for havin'
A girl of my sweet dreams
A good lookin' heart stoppin' sweet young thing like you
