                        Song: Mama - Jonas Blue, William Singe

[Verse 1] 
Where should we run to? 
We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play 
They say we're wasted 
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day? 
Okay, I got the keys to the universe 
So stay with me 'cause I got the keys, baby 

[Pre-Chorus] 
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we done more 
I wanna live fast and never look back, that's what we here for 
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go 
'Cause we'll be home before we know, I wanna hear you sing it 

[Chorus] 
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind 
We coming home tonight 
Hey, mama, we gonna be alright 
Dry those eyes 
We'll be back in the morning when the sun stars to rise 
So mama, don't stress your mind 
So mama, don't stress your mind 

[Post-Chorus] 
Mama, mama, mama, hey 
We coming home tonight 
Mama, mama, mama, hey 
We coming home tonight 

[Verse 2] 
Where should be run to? 
We got a ticket that takes us wherever we like 
We got our problems 
But just for the minute, let's push all our troubles aside 
Alright 'cause we got the keys to the universe 
Inside our minds, yeah, we got the keys, baby 

[Pre-Chorus] 
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we done more 
I wanna live fast and never look back, that's what we here for 
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go 
'Cause we'll be home before we know, I wanna hear you sing it 

[Chorus] 
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind 
We coming home tonight 
Hey, mama, we gonna be alright 
Dry those eyes 
We'll be back in the morning when the sun stars to rise 
So mama, don't stress your mind 
So mama, don't stress your mind 
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind 
We coming home tonight 
Hey, mama, we gonna be alright 
Dry those eyes 
We'll be back in the morning when the sun stars to rise 
So mama, don't stress your mind 
So mama, don't stress your mind 

[Post-Chorus] 
Mama, mama, mama, hey 
We coming home tonight 
Mama, mama, mama, hey 
We coming home tonight
