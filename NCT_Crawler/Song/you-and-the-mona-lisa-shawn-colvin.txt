 Hold me down to anything
 Anything that you see
 I should walk away right now
 I'll be there, so never mind
 I'll be the one to fall
 Waiting for you to look up at me


 Oh I love you the most
 Always giving up the ghost
 In your own private conversation
 You're a sweet mystery
 There is nothing in between
 You and the Mona Lisa


 Nothing in particular
 And everything in between
 This is what you mean to me
 Only you and only me
 Climbing in the right direction
 On the way to everything


 We were walking up high
 And no one thought to try
 But I was the one to blame
 And it was just a mirage
 So I hid in the garage
 'Til somebody called your name


 Oh I love you the most
 Always giving up the ghost
 In your own private conversation
 You're a sweet mystery
 And there's nothing in between
 You and the Mona Lisa


 Nothing in particular
 Just you and the Mona Lisa...
