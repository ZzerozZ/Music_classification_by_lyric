                        Bài hát: I Don't Care - Apocalyptica, Adam Gontier

I try to make it through my life,
In my way there's you...
I try to make it through these lies
That's all I do

Just don't deny it,
Just don't deny it
And deal with it,
Yeah, deal with it
You tried to break me
You wanna break me
Bit by bit
That's just part of it.

If you were dead or still alive,
I don't care,
I don't care
And all the things you left behind,
I don't care,
I don't care

I try to make you see my side
Always try to stay in line
But your eyes see right through
That's all they do
I'm getting tired of this ***
I've got no room when it's like this
What you want of me, just deal with it

So...

If you were dead or still alive,
I don't care,
I don't care
And all the things you left behind,
I don't care,
I don't care

[Cello solo]

[In the background:]
Nothing can care about,
I'm taking care of it.
You won't be there for me,
You won't be there for me.

[Piano solo]

If you were dead or still alive,
I don't care,
I don't care
And all the things you left behind,
I don't care,
I don't care

If you were dead or still alive
I don't care (nothing can care about)
I don't care... (I'm taking care of it)
And all the things you've left behind
I don't care (you won't be there for me.)
I don't care... at all.
