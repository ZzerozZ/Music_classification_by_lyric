                        It's 50 Cent and S N double O P
 You don't want no Snoop and you don't want it wit me Every time I come around they like, "Oh no"
 I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my 44
 ***, I been through in my hood made my heart cold
 I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco No sense in coppin' pleas
 When you see my knife out
 (Knife out)
 Motherfuckers light out
 (Lights out) Here comes Snoop
 (Oh ***, oh no)
 Sup, nigga, sup, now
 (Oh no) Ricky Ticky Timble, C's is the symbol
 Courdoroy khakis, stacies and brimmed up
 Straight razors just to keep you trimmed up
 1 8 7, oh yeah, now you remember
 He's electrifyin' and original So gangster, Snoop Dogg the criminal
 The one you hate to love in the club, in the cut
 Hugged up wit yo bitch, nigga, I don't give a ***
 You betta check dat ho that's what wreckin' G
 Now, step your game down 'cause ain't no checkin' me You'll be respectin' me until you leave this room
 Or my gat'll go boom, bullets go zoom
 Now, your names on a tomb
 They pourin' out liquor wit no room to consume, you silly bafoon
 I pop niggas like balloons, I ain't feelin' 'em
 Walkin' in my big, blue chucks 'cause I'm killin' 'em Every time I come around they like, "Oh no"
 I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my 44
 ***, I been through in my hood made my heart cold
 I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco No sense in coppin' pleas
 When you see my knife out
 (Knife out)
 Motherfuckers light out
 (Lights out) Hey whaddup 'cuz it's 50 Cent, what's happenin', nigga? Ever since the moment I was born I been dyin'
 (Yeah)
 Hundred miles an hour, pulse flyin' wit my eye an
 He who fears fate lives like a coward
 You go against me, you'll be devoured Then you get to poppin' you'll have a change of heart
 I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
 Have doc usin' donors, dead niggas with spare parts
 You come back wit lungs of a snitch an the heart of a dead nark Niggas never see the light till it spark
 Then they bleed, it get cold then *** get dark
 You can call me the beast from the East, I run these streets
 You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
 Push me a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin'
 Your services are no longer needed, rock a bye, baby
 My bitch'll do it to you with a lil' 380
 (Yeah) Every time I come around they like, "Oh no"
 I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my 44
 ***, I been through in my hood made my heart cold
 I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco No sense in coppin' pleas
 When you see my knife out
 (Knife out)
 Motherfuckers light out
 (Lights out) I'm bailin' through the door again
 Let the Momo pour again
 Me and my ho again
 Yeah, she got the four up in this motherfucker
 And I'ma bust it if you try to rush us
 Or touch us or sucka duck us It'll crack off, now, back off real slow
 An if you don't know, I never hesitate to shoot a ho
 Yeah that's my reputation, you test my patience and
 You and your fam bam gon' hear the blam, blam
 Goddammit, I'm at it again They done let that bitch, nigga up outta the pen
 And now he lookin' for me what the heck? My game is built on respect
 Now, I'm breathin' down your mortherfuckin' neck
 I dumps till my clips is empty I'm headin' down Willshire to San Vicente
 And when I get there don't ask who sent me
 Just take dem shots an drop it like it's hot
 Bitch, nigga Every time I come around they like, "Oh no"
 I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my 44
 ***, I been through in my hood made my heart cold
 I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco No sense in coppin' pleas
 When you see my knife out
 (Knife out)
 Motherfuckers light out
 (Lights out) Yea, nigga, just when you thought I was gone
 Slide back up on you like the wind, nigga
 Hurricane D O double G
 With the G,G,G,G,G, G-unit
