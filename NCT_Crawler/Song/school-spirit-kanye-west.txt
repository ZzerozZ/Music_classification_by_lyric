                        You keep it going man, you keep those books rolling
 You pick up all those books that your going to read
 And not remember and you roll, man
 You get that a sociate degree, okay Then you get your bachelors, then you get your masters
 Then you get your master's masters
 Then you get your doctrine, you go, man
 And then when everybody says quit
 You show them those degrees, man When everybody says, "Hey
 You're not working, you're not making any money"
 You say, "You look at my degrees and you look at my life
 Yeah, I'm fifty two, so what, hate all you want But I'm smart, I'm so smart, and I'm in school
 These guys are out here making money all these ways
 And I'm spendin' mine to be smart, you know why?
 Because when I die, buddy, you know
 What's going to keep me warm, that's right, those degrees"
