                        We were waiting for the bus
 No one much around but us
 Then I see this young boy
 Caught a look at me I'm stunned in a daze
 He had the whole street set ablaze
 It's only love they say
 Makes you feel this way She liked his eyes, she wanted more
 The baby gonna have your smile for sure
 He saw a lovely girl
 Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
 She saw him looking, acted like she didn't care That's how we knew
 And so love grew a flower
 A flower that is you Your daddy knows you're a flame
 Your daddy knows you're a flame
 Your daddy knows you're a flame
 Your daddy knows you're a flame Even to the angels it may sound like a lie
 For you, child
 He has the troops and extra backup standing by For you, child
 For you, he's the best he can be
 For you, child
 For you, he's the best he can be Oh, child don't you know?
 Your daddy love come
 With a lifetime guarantee Your daddy knows you're a flame
 Your daddy knows you're a flame
 Yeah, daddy loves you child
 Your daddy knows you're a flame, oh
 Your daddy knows you're a flame
 Daddy love you, yeah It's only you he'll say
 Made the young boy hungry
 For the man he is today
 It's only love, love, love, love
 Can make you feel this way Your daddy knows you're a flame, oh
 Your daddy knows you're a flame
 Yeah, daddy loves you child
