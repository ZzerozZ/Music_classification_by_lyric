I love you
I love you

She thinks that love is overrated
She says she's heard it all before
Keep saying chivalry has faded
Girl I can't wait to prove you wrong

I'll give you the world if you want
Or we could take the top down by the coastline
Kissing every red light

Let me love you old school
I know you will dig it
Let me take you downtown
Date night, I'll make it
Make it all about you
Everything that I do
Is to love you old school
Let me love you old school

You tell me we are complicated
So I bring flowers to your door
Keep saying we will never make it
Girl I can't wait to prove you wrong

I'll give you the world if you want
And we can count the stars in the bright night
Kissing in the moonlight

Let me love you old school
I know you will dig it
Let me take you downtown
Date night, I'll make it
Make it all about you
Everything that I do
Is to love you old school
(I love you)
Let me love you old school
(I love you)
Let me love you old school

Let me love you old school
Let me love you old school
I'll give you the world if you want
I want to hear you say woo
When the beat drops banging on the boombox

Let me love you old school
I know you will dig it
Let me take you downtown
Date night, I'll make it
Make it all about you
Everything that I do
Is to love you old school
(I love you)
Let me love you old school
(I love you)
Let me love you old school
Let me love you old school
Let me love you old school
(I love you)
(I love you)
