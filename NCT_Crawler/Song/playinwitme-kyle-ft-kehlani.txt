Girl, why are you playin' with me?
Girl, who are you playin' with?
You've been on that new stuff
I've been on the same ***
Girl, why are you playin' with me?
I don't got the time for that
Might need me a refund, haha

I'ma need that time back
You say you'll try
I've heard that lie a thousand times before
I'm not sad, I'm not cryin'
If you mad, that's fine, but I think that I should go
Yeah, why you tryna play me?
You bein' a different you and I'm bein' the same me
You could have had Gucci, but now that's Old Navy

And your homegirl wanna date me, she shady, baby
Girl, why are you playin' with me?
Girl, who are you playin' with?
You've been on that new stuff
I've been on the same ***
Girl, why are you playin' with me? (With me, with me)
I don't got no time for that
Might need me a refund, yeah
I'ma need that time back

Damn, why are you playin' with me?
You don't even like girls, ha
So I need you to tell me, baby
What you want just like the Spice Girls
It's confusin' 'cause you're flirty
But you ain't gon' be the one to say you ever did me dirty
I got pride for that, pay no mind to that
But believe me, if it's fire, I'll make time for that

I'll be faithful, Johnny Cash, walk the line for that
Otherwise, I'll just be single and I'm fine with that, huh
Girl, why are you playin' with me?
Girl, who are you playin' with?
You've been on that new stuff
And I've been on the same ***
Girl, why are you playin' with me?

I ain't got no time for that
Might need me a refund
'Cause I'ma need that time back
Girl, why are you playin' with me?
Girl, who are you playin' with?
Girl, why are you playin' with me?
Girl, who are you playin' with?
Girl, who are you playin' with? Yeah
Who, yeah

Yeah
I've been on the same ***
Girl, why are you playin' with me?
Girl, who are you playin' with? Huh
You've been on that new stuff
And I've been on the same ***
Girl, why are you playin' with me?
I don't got no time for that
Might need me a refund (refund)
I'ma need that time back, yeah
Da-da-da
