                        Back in the Ronald Reagan days
 When we put satellites in space
 When boys wore skinny leather ties
 Like Don Johnson from Miami Vice
 When M&M was just a snack
 And Arnie told us "I'll be back"
 Back when the coolest thing in store
 Was a Commodore 64
 Back to the 80's
 Back to Soap
 Back to Rocky and Cherry Coke
 Those were the days
 And we go
 Back to the 80's
 And hey there Mr.T
 To Twisted Sisters on MTV, yeah
 Those were the days
 I come back
 To Iron Maiden and 7UP
 Bananarama and Breakfast Club
 Come Back, Yeah
 Come Back, Yeah
 I Come Back
 When Huey Lewis was the news
 When we went flying with Tom Cruise
 When shoulderpads was looking tough
 lost a dare to David Hasselhoff
 Too many men with heavy makeup on
 Too many poodles with guitars
 Thanks for all the joy you've given us
 You will always be our superstars
 Back to the 80's
 Back to Soap
 Back to Rocky and Cherry Coke
 Those were the days
 And we go
 Back to the 80's
 And hey there Mr.T
 To Twisted Sisters on MTV, yeah
 Those were the days
 I come back
 To Iron Maiden and 7UP
 Bananarama and Breakfast Club
 Come Back, Yeah
 Come Back, Yeah
 I Come Back
 Hooray for Cosby and Rubik's Cube
 Hooray for Dynasty and Moon Boots
 Hooray for Devo and Barber Curls
 Hooray for Poltergeist and Barbie Girls
 Back to the 80's
 Back to Soap
 Back to Rocky and Cherry Coke
 Those were the days
 Lets go back
 Back to the 80's
 To Mr.T
 To Twisted Sisters on MTV, yeah
 Those were the days
 I come back
 To Iron Maiden and 7UP
 Bananarama and Breakfast Club
 Come Back, Yeah
 Come Back, Yeah
 Lets go back
