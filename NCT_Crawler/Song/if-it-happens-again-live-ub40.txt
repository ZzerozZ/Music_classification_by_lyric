                        If it happens again I'm leaving, I'll pack all my things and go
 If it happens again there'll be no looking back and I won't say I told you so, I won't say I told you so
 You did what you were told and you took the strain
 Been left out in the cold, got yourself to blame
 But believe me, if it happens again, I'm leaving, if it stays the same, I'm gone
 When you're stabbed in the back and there's salt in the wound then it's time to move along
 If it happens again I'm leaving, I'll pack all my things and go
 If it happens again there'll be no looking back and I won't say I told you so, I won't say I told you so

 No more spanners in the works, all the works been done
 Had your face rubbed in the dirt on show for every one
 But believe me, if it happens again, I'm leaving, if it stays the same, I'm gone
 When compromise is the song that you sing, it's been going on to long
 If it happens again I'm leaving, I'll pack all my things and go
 If it happens again there'll be no looking back and I won't say I told you so, I won't say I told you so

 If it happens again I'm leaving, I'll pack all my things and go
 If it happens again there'll be no looking back and I won't say I told you so, I won't say I told you so
 If it happens again I'm leaving, I'll pack all my things and go
 If it happens again there'll be no looking back and I won't say I told you so, I won't say I told you so
