                        Bumble bees
I know I'm not the only flower you see
But what can I do, you are a good looking bee
Wham bam, thank you mam

Bumble bee, bump into me
I am in for pollination
Bumble bee, take what you see
I'm in need for your donation
I can't wait for your invasion

Be my love
Cause I'm a single flower, feeling free
Blooming now
Take me honey, be my favorite bee

Hey Rose I'm ready again
I've got my radar tuned in on you baby
I'm all set and ready to land
I'm the bomb, here I come
Getting ready for a wham bam

Bumble bee, bump into me
I am in for pollination
Bumble bee, take what you see
I'm in need for your donation
You don't need no invitation

Wham bam, thank you mam
I'm going wham bam, thank you mam
I'm a true believer, that goes for what I see
And one little flower is not enough for a bee, like me

All I know
Is you're my honey, and I can't say no
Just a little bit shy
And so excited, when I see you fly

Hey Rose I'm ready again
I've got my radar tuned in on you baby
I'm all set and ready to land
I'm the bomb, here I come

Getting ready for a wham bam

Bumble bee, bump into me
I am in for pollination
Bumble bee, take what you see
I'm in need for your donation
You don't need no invitation

Wham bam, thank you mam
I'm going wham bam, thank you mam
I'm a true believer, that goes for what I see
And one little flower is not enough for a bee
No, one little flower is not enough for a bee, like me

I know I'm not the only flower you see
But what can I do, you are a good looking bee
Honey, it's a job, it's a dream come true
You're my favourite flower, when I'm intimate with you

Wham bam, thank you mam
I'm going wham bam, thank you mam
I'm going wham bam, thank you mam
I'm a true believer, that goes for what I see
And one little flower is not enough for a bee

Going wham bam, thank you mam
I'm going wham bam, thank you mam
I'm a true believer, that goes for what I see
And you, my flower ain't enough for me
You got to be faithful, it's not fair for a bee
You got to be faithful, it's not fair for a bee - like me
