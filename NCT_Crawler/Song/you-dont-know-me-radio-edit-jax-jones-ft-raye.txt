                        Bài hát: You Don't Know Me - Jax Jones, Raye

Ooh, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
You don't know me 

Oh yeah, time is money so don't *** with mine 
See I'm out with my girls, I'ma have a good time 
Step back with your chit-chat, killin' my vibe 

See, I can't get too much of a good thing 
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things 
Well, please hold your tongue, oh, don't say a damn thing 
See your iPhone camera flashin' 
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin' 
You here for long? Oh no, I'm just passin' 
Do you wanna drink? No, thanks for askin' 

Ooh, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
You don't know me, oh yeah 
Ooh, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
You don't know me, oh yeah 

I mean, we could throw shapes together 
But it doesn't mean you're in my circle, yeah 
Cruise through life and I'm feelin' on track 
If you can't keep up, then you better fall back 
'Cause money look better when I see it all stacked up 

See, I can't get too much of a good thing 
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things 
Well, please hold your tongue, oh, don't say a damn thing 
See your iPhone camera flashin' 
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin' 
You here for long? Oh no, I'm just passin' 
Do you wanna drink? No, thanks for askin' 

Ooh, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
You don't know me, oh yeah 
Ooh, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
You don't know me, oh yeah 

You're not here just know though 
Won't get what you want, what you want, what you want, want 
Tell you what you don't know 
I get what I want, what I want, what I want, want 

See your iPhone camera flashin' 
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin' 
You here for long? Oh no, I'm just passin' 
Do you wanna drink? No, thanks for askin' 

Ooh, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah 
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah 
You don't know me, oh yeah 

You don't know me, oh yeah
