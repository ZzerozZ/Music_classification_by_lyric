                        Bài hát : Popular Song - Mika, Ariana Grande

La la, la la
You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish
Standing on the field with your pretty pompom
Now you're working at the movie selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
'Cause I'm putting down my story in a popular song
I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

[Chorus:]
My problem, I never was a model,
I never was a scholar,
But you were always popular,
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row
'Cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go

Always on the lookout for someone to hate,
Picking on me like a dinner plate
You hid during classes, and in between 'em
Dunked me in the toilets, now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughing, got everyone clapping, asking,
"How come you look so cool?"
'Cause that's the only thing that I've learned at school, boy (uh huh)
I said that that's the only thing that I've learned at school

[Chorus:]
My problem, I never was a model,
I never was a scholar,
But you were always popular,
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row
'Cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
(that's all you ever need to know)

So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go

It's all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
It's all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
(It's all you ever need to know)
It's all you ever need to know

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you.
That's all you ever need to know...
(That's all you ever need to know...)
