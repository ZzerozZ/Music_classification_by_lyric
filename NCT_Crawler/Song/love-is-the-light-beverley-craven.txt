                        Song: Love Is The Light 
Singer: Beverley Craven

Someone turned the light out in my life
 And I don't know if I can make it through the night
 I'm afraid to wake tomorrow
 With no one by my side
 When all the words that broke my heart
 Will still be on my mind
 Love is the light
 That filled my life with dreams
 When it used to shine on me
 Finally the spark has faded in the dark I believed that love would find a way
 Now I don't know if I could give it all again
 After all the words of wisdom
 That fill me with regret
 I'd rather cry remembering
 The times I can't forget Love is the light
 That filled my life with dreams
 When it used to shine on me
 Finally the spark has faded in the dark Love is the light
 That filled my life with dreams
 When it used to shine on me
 Finally the spark has faded Love is the light
 That filled my life with dreams
 When it used to shine on me
                        
                    |
