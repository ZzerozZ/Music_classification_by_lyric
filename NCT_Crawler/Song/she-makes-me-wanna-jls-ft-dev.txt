                        I cant explain what’s gotten into me
My sanity is in the passenger seat
I let her drive me she is my guide
We’re flying reckless tonight


Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
Imma get it on on on on
Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
Imma get it on on on on


Chorus
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
London to jamaica
La to africa
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh


I think her eyes are hypnotizing me
Something about her turns me into a wild beast
I mesmerized, down for the ride
Flying reckless tonight


Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
Imma get it on on on on
Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
Imma get it on on on on


Chorus


Well that’s kind of funny
I-i was just thinking
How you make me oh-oh-oh
we’re flying over buildings
Sitting under palm trees
drinking bubble gum drinks
We’re counting all our monies
Dancing in ice rinks
Buying icies (it’s nothing)
We’re loving
We’re worthy of this
Look where I come from
Now this world our kingdom


She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x4)


London to jamaica
L.a to africa
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
