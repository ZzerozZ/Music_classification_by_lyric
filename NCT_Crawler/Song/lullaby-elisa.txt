                        Lyrics: Elisa They call me Lullaby
 'cause all I want and all I know is only to fly
 They call me Lullaby
 I've never seen their blood
 I've never seen
 That sparkle in their eyes
 I don't know
 What's hidden in their minds
 They call me lullaby
 One day I saw a man
 Trying to wash away the dirt on his hands
 And the pain on his face when he saw me
 He wished that he could cry
 And he called me Lullaby And first of all we were born to be free
 And as far as I can see
 There is one way this could be
 I've been told we were born to be free
 And as far as I can see
 There is one way this could be But they struggle and they fight
 They weep but they still try
 Everything that they can
 Everything that they can
 And they call me Lullaby
 And they wish they would they have
 Everything that they can
 Everything that they can
 And they call me Lullaby And so me
 I'll fly, I'll fly
 Just like a lullaby
 Just like a lullaby
 Until the day I'll die
 Oh me
 I'll fly, I'll fly
 Like a lullaby
 Like a lullaby
 Until the day I'll die
 I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly
                        
                    |
