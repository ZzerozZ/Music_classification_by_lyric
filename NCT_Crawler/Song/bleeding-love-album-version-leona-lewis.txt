                        Closed off from love
 I didn't need the pain
 Once or twice was enough
 And it was all in vain
 Time starts to pass
 Before you know it you're frozen

 Ooooh...

 But something happened
 For the very first time with you
 My heart melted to the ground
 Found something true
 And everyone's looking 'round
 Thinking I'm going crazy

 Oooh,

 But I don't care what they say
 I'm in love with you
 They try to pull me away
 But they don't know the truth
 My heart's crippled by the vein
 That I keep on closing
 You cut me open and I

 Keep bleeding
 I Keep, keep bleeding love
 I keep bleeding
 I keep, keep bleeding love
 Keep bleeding
 Keep, keep bleeding love
 You cut me open and I

 Oooh, oooh...

 Trying hard not to hear
 But they talk so loud
 Their piercing sounds fill my ears
 Try to fill me with doubt
 Yet I know that their goal
 Is to keep me from falling

 Hey, yeah!

 But nothing's greater
 Than the rush that comes with your embrace
 And in this world of loneliness
 I see your face
 Yet everyone around me
 Thinks that I'm going crazy
 Maybe, maybe

 But I don't care what they say
 I'm in love with you
 They try to pull me away
 But they don't know the truth
 My heart's crippled by the vein
 That I keep on closing
 You cut me open and I

 Keep bleeding
 I Keep, keep bleeding love
 I keep bleeding
 I keep, keep bleeding love
 Keep bleeding
 Keep, keep bleeding love
 You cut me open and I

 And it's draining all of me
 Oh they find it hard to believe
 I'll be wearing these scars
 For everyone to see

 I don't care what they say
 I'm in love with you
 They try to pull me away
 But they don't know the truth
 My heart's crippled by the pain
 That I keep all closed in
 You cut me open and I

 Keep bleeding
 Keep, keep bleeding love
 I keep bleeding
 I keep, keep bleeding love
 Keep bleeding
 Keep, keep bleeding love
 You cut me open and I

 Keep bleeding
 Keep, keep bleeding love
 I keep bleeding
 I keep, keep bleeding love
 Keep bleeding
 Keep, keep bleeding love
 You cut me open and I
 Keep bleeding
 Keep, keep bleeding love
