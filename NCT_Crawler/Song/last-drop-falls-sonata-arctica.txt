                        When I'm looking in your eyes
 Everything seems to fade away
 After all these years we had do I know you now
 Have I trusted blindly in your love, too many times You said: "hey, my love, I'm sorry but we can't go on 'cause
 I'm in love with someone else"
 Tell me, what do you want me to say
 When you treat me this way Oh I love you, maybe?
 And I hope it goes away
 Oh, how I want you daily
 I know it's gonna stay You are so self satisfied
 Always ready for a ride
 Double crossing, lousy cheat, love you anyway
 You have warm and tender devils soul, you are so low I can hear you say: "I'm sorry, should we still go on,
 I'm not in love with that someone else"
 Tell me, what do you want me to say
 When you treat me this way Oh I love you, maybe?
 And I hope it goes away
 Oh, how I want you daily
 Tell me now that... I have found the *** in you
 Why can't I tell you "NO"
 Time will show, the last word is for me
 If you fail to see the problem we have, one room full of walls
 Jar of love isn't dry until the last drop falls The moment I will step aside, you're ready for another ride
 Walking in the cool night air without underwear
 You have red light burning in your soul, I've seen the glow In every dream I have I say: "I'm not in love with you"
 But every day I say I do
 You have messed with my head so many times
 Forced me to love you [spoken] Now that...
 I have found the *** in you
 why Can't I tell you "NO"
 Time will show, the last word is for me
 If you fail to see the problem we have, one room full of walls
 I will try until the last drop falls.. (X2)
