Rock|

                        On a long and lonesome highway,
 East of Omaha
 You can listen to the engines
 Moanin' out it's one old song
 You can think about the woman,
 Or the girl you knew the night before
 But your thoughts will soon be wanderin',
 The way they always do
 When you're ridin' 16 hours,
 And there's nothin' much to do
 And you don't feel much like ridin',
 You just wish the trip was through (chorus) Here I am, on the road again,
 There I am, up on the stage
 There I go, playin' star again,
 There I go, turn the page So you walk into this restaurant,
 Uh strung out from the road
 And you feel the eyes upon you,
 As you're shakin' off the cold
 You pretend it doesn't bother you,
 But you just want to explode
 Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk,
 Other times you can All the same old clich's,
 Is it woman, is it man
 And you always seem outnumbered,
 You don't dare make a stand
 Make your stand (chorus)
 Ah But here I am, on the road again,
 There I am, up on the stage
 Here I go, ah playin' star again,
 There I go, turn the page
 Woah Out there in the spotlight,
 You're a million miles away
 Every ounce of energy,
 You try and give away
 As the sweat pours out your body,
 Like the music that you play Later in the evenin',
 As you lie awake in bed
 With the echoes of the amplifiers,
 Ringin' in your head
 You smoke the day's last cigarette,
 Rememberin' what she said What she said Yeah, and here I am,
 On the road again,
 There I am, up on that stage
 Here I go, playin' star again,
 There I go, turn the page
 And there I go, turn that page There I go, yeah, Here I go, yeah, yeah
 There I go, yeah, Here I go, yeah
 Here I go-oh-o, There I go
 And I'm gone
                        
                    |
