                        Bài hát: Smoke Gets In Your Eyes - The Platters

They asked me how I knew 
My true love was true 
Oh, I of course replied 
Something here inside cannot be denied 

They said someday you'll find 
All who love are blind 
Oh, when your heart's on fire 
You must realize 
Smoke gets in your eyes 

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed 
To think they could doubt my love 
Yet today my love has flown away 
I am without my love 

Now laughing friends deride 
Tears I can not hide 
Oh, so I smile and say 
When a lovely flame dies 
Smoke gets in your eyes 
Smoke gets in your eyes
                        
                    |
