                        Song: Entertainer - Zayn

[Verse 1]
You thought you had me, didn't you?
When you lied to my face, I could see the truth
Every step with the way I knew
How you fooled me, boo

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess you didn’t know that you were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, and laugh with, and *** with you
Don't you take me for a fool
In this game, I own the rules
You were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, I laugh with, with fake it too
Don't you take me for a fool
I’ma show you a thing or two

[Chorus]
Never seen you comin', I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never seen me comin', I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

[Verse 2]
Thought that you were smarter, I'm ashamed for you
I knew it right away when you stopped lovin' me
It happened when your touch wasn't enough for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought that you should know that you were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, and laugh with, and *** with you
Don’t you take me for a fool
In this game, I own the rules
You were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, I laugh with, with fake it too
Don’t you take me for a fool
I'ma show you a thing or two

[Chorus]
Never seen you comin’, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never seen me comin', I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

[Bridge]
Know it’s harder to take, and let's face it
No one's playing your games, let's face it
I'm bein' straight up
I know fake love when I see it anyway
I'ma turn you down when you need me anyway, anyway, anyway

[Chorus]
Never seen you comin', I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never seen me comin', I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

[Outro]
I know you need me the most
The most, the most
One more time
                        
                    |
