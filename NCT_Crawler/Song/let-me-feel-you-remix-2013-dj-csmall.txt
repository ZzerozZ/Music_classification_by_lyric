                        Bài hát: Let Me Feel You (Remix 2013) - DJ CSmall

Hey ey ey
Love to hold you in my arms
Hey ey ey
Let me feel you

Fine as I could be since I know
That you're only playing with me
I just fly so free
Everytime you get any closer to me

They say you're coming
They say you want me
You make me happy
Everyone is telling that

You say I'm naughty
Then say I'm funny
You wanna hold me close
Cause you want me

Hey ey ey
Love to hold you in my arms
Hey ey ey
Let me feel you

So you're into me
Now I know 
That all I feel for you is true
You just hide from me
Everytime I get any closer to you

They say you're coming
They say you want me
You make me happy
Everyone is telling that

You say I'm naughty
Then say I'm funny
You wanna hold me close
Cause you want me

Hey ey ey
Love to hold you in my arms
Hey ey ey
Let me feel you
                        
                    |
