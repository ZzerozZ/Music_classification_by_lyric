                        My body's burning like a flame that's blue It's time for action and I want it from you.
 Slice me nice - slice me nice.
 My heart is beating to the rhythm of love I need you
 baby
 like cold hands need a glove.
 Slice me nice - slice me nice. I'm like a cake that wants to be baked I'm like a pie made for hungry guys.
 My body's burning like a flame that's blue It's time for action
 baby
 got me and you.
 Slice me nice - slice me nice. SLICE - slice me nice
 SLICE - slice me nice S L I C E - slice me nice
 S L I C E - slice me nice Slice me nice.
 My body's burning like a flame that's blue
 . . .
 I'm like a cake that wants to be baked
 . . .
 S L I C E - slice me nice
 S L I C E - slice me nice
 . . .
 SLICE - slice me nice
 SLICE - slice me nice
