                        Bài hát: New Light - John Mayer

Ah, ah
I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna stay to look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say anyway
Oh, we can go far from the end
And make a new world together baby

'Cause if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay

Ah
Yeah, if you give me just one night
You gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

What do I do with all this?
What do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you
What do I do with all this?
What do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you
What do I do with all this?
What do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you
What do I do with all this?
What do I do with all this
