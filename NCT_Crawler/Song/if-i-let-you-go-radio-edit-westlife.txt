Westlife-If I Let You Go
Album:If I Let You Go

Shane:Day after day
Time passed away
And I just can't get you off my mind

Nobody knows
I hide it inside
I keep on searching
but I can't find

Mark:The courage to show
to letting you know
I've never felt
so much love before

All(Shane lead):And once again
I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out

All: But if I let you go
I will never know
What my life would be
holding you close to me
Will I ever see
you smiling back at me
(Shane: oh yeah)
How will I know
Shane: if I let you go

Bryan:Night after night
I hear myself say
Why can't this feeling
just fade away

There's no one like you
(no one like you)
You speak to my heart
(speak to my heart)
It's such a shame
we're worlds apart

Shane:I'm too shy to ask
I'm too proud to lose
But sooner or later
I gotta choose
And once again
I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out

All: But if I let you go
I will never know
What my life would be
holding you close to me
Will I ever see
you smiling back at me
(oh yeah)
How will I know
Shane: if I let you go

Shane:If I let you go
ooooh baby

Bryan:Once again
I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out

All: But if I let you go
I will never know
What my life would be
holding you close to me
(Mark: close to me)
Will I ever see
you smiling back at me
(Shane: oh yeah)
How will I know
(Bryan: if I let you go)
But if I let you go
I will never know
(Mark: oh baby)

Will I ever see
you smiling back at me
(Shane: oh yeah)
How will I know

Shane: if I let you go
