                        One Love
Justin Bieber

I won't let the night stand in my way
I know what I want, I know what I can
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is lay down next you

Cause I all I need is one love
Cause I all I need is one love
Baby give it to me
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need tonight

See i've made mistakes time after time, time, time
But no not today, won't leave till I find what i'm looking for
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is dance under the moon

Cause I all I need is one love
Cause I all I need is one love
Baby give it to me
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need tonight

Your love is like a rollercoaster
The way that you take my breath away
It feels like i'm slowly falling deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper
Cause I all I need is one love
Cause I all I need is one love
Baby give it to me
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, can give it to me
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need
