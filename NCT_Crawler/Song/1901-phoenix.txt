                        Bài hát: 1901 - Phoenix

Counting all different ideas drifting away
Past and present they don’t matter
Now the future’s sorted out
Watch her moving in elliptical patterns
Think it’s not what you say
What you say is way too complicated
For a minute thought I couldn’t tell how to fall out

It’s twenty seconds 'til the last call
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know it’s easy
Like we did it over summer long

And I’ll be anything you ask and more
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
It’s not a miracle we needed
And no I wouldn’t let you think so

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it

Girlfriend, oh your girlfriend is drifting away
Past and present 1855-1901
Watch them built up a material tower
Think it’s not gonna stay anyway
I think it’s overrated
For a minute thought I couldn’t tell how to fall out

It’s twenty seconds 'til the last call
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know it’s easy
Like we did it over summer long

And I’ll be anything you ask and more
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
It’s not a miracle we needed
And no I wouldn’t let you think so

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
