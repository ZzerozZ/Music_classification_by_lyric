                        Bài hát: Ain't Your Mama - Jennifer Lopez

I ain't cooking all day (I ain't your mama!)
I ain't gon' do your laundry (I ain't your mama!)
I ain't your mama, boy (I ain't your mama!)
When you're going get your act together?
I ain't your mama...
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no!

Wake up, rise and shine, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Let's get to work on time, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
No more playing video games, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Things are about to change, I hear, I hear...

We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how we were?
When did you get too comfortable?
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey

I ain't cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you're going get your act together?
I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no

Lucky to have these curves, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Stuck hitting on my nerves, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You're still tryna ride this train? Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
But something's gotta change, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah

We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how we were?
When did you get too comfortable?
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey!

I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
(I ain't your mama, no)
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama
(I ain't your mama, hey)
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you're gon' get your act together?
I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama)
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
I ain't your mama, no

We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how we were?
When did you get too comfortable?
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey

I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama)
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama)
I ain't your mama, boy (No, no, no)
I ain't your mama, boy (No, no)
When you're gon' get your act together? (Cause I ain't your mama, hey)
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama, hey)
I ain't your mama, boy (Na, na, na...)
I ain't your mama, boy (Na, na, na...)
When you're gon' get your act together?
(No, I ain't your mama, no...)
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama

(No, I ain't your mama, no...!)
