                        Bài hát: Fernando - ABBA

Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums 
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say 
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus:]
There was something in the air that night, the stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me, for liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret
If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando

If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and gray Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the faithful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

(Chorus) (2x)

Yes if I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando
                        
                    |
