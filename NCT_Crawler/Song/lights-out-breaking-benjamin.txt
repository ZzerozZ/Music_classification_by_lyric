                        I am done pretending
 You have failed to find what's left
 I will suck you dry again
 Some are not worth saving
 You are such a pretty mess
 I will choke the life within Now you want to take me down
 As if I even care
 I am the monster in your head
 And I thought you'd learn by now
 It seems you haven't yet
 I am the venom in your skin And now your life is broken After the lights go out on you
 After your worthless life is through
 I will remember how you scream
 I can't afford to care, I can't afford to care I am suffocating, you have failed to pull me in
 I will drag you down again
 Life is unrelenting, feeding lies into my head
 I will feed the lies you live Now you want to take me down
 As if I even care
 I am the monster in your head
 And I thought you'd learn by now
 It seems you haven't yet
 I am the venom in your skin And now your life is broken After the lights go out on you
 After your worthless life is through
 I will remember how you scream
 I can't afford to care, I can't afford to care After the lights go out on you
 After your worthless life is through
 I will remember how you scream
 I can't afford to care, I can't afford to care
 I can't afford to care, I can't afford to care
                        
                    |
