Blues/Jazz|

                        She is like the lady down the road
Or just the woman up the street,
Like any mother you may know.
To me, she is the one who had it planned
To lead us all to Wonderland,
She always wanted us to go,
And she said
Don’t ever be lonely,
Remember, I’ll always care.
Wherever you may be
Remember I will be there.
And like another lady that we know
She has a smile so bright and sweet,
And hair as white as driven snow;
Though life is never easy day to day,
She has a very special way
To make us smile when we are low.
And she says:
Don’t ever be lonely
Remember, I’ll always care.
Wherever you may be
Remember I will be there.
Don’t ever be lonely
Remember, I will be there.
I will be there.
I will be there.
