 Song: Time After Time
 Artist: Cyndi Lauper
Lying in my bed i hear the clock tick,
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion
Is nothing new
Flashback warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories,
Time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, i can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me ... ...
Time after time
If you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting ... ...
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me ... ...
Time after time
If you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting ... ...
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering ...
If i'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me ....
Time after time
If you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting ....
Time after time

You said go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me ...
Time after time
If you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting ....
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me ....
Time after time
If you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting
Time after time

Time after time

Time after time

Time after time
