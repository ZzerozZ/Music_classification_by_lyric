                        Heaven comes to he who waits
 But I know I'm getting nowhere
 And all the deeds of yesterday
 Have really helped to pave my way Though there's no one near me now
 How come everyone can touch me now?
 You see the torture on my brow
 Relates to neither here nor now Watch me bleed
 Bleed forever
 Watch me bleed
 Bleed forever
 Although my face is straight it lies
 My body feels the pain and cries Here the table is not bare
 I am full but feeling empty
 For all the warmth it feels so cold
 Ooh I'm so young I feel so old Watch me bleed
 Bleed forever
 Watch me bleed
 Bleed forever
 It's not allowed to be unkind
 But still the hate lives in my mind I'll make no noise I'll hide my pain
 I'll close my eyes I won't complain
 I'll lie right back and take the blame
 And try to tell myself I'm living And when it's all been said or done
 Where do I go? Where do I run?
 What's left of me or anyone
 When we've denied the hurting?
 Oh oh oh oh oh
 Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa And when it's all been said or done
 Where do I go, where do I run?
 What's left of me or anyone
 When we've denied the hurting ?
 Oh oh oh oh oh Watch me bleed
 Bleed forever
 Watch me bleed
 Bleed forever
 And all the deeds of yesterday
 Have really helped to pave my way Watch me bleed
 Bleed forever
 Watch me bleed
 Bleed forever
 And all the deeds of yesterday
 Have really helped to pave my way
