                        Give me time to reason,
 Give me time to think it through
 Passing through the season,
 Where I cheated you

 I will always have a cross to wear,
 But the bolt reminds me I was there

 So give me strength,
 To face this test tonight

 If only I could turn back time
 If only I had said what I still hide
 If only I could turn back time
 I would stay for the night. For the night...

 Claim your right to science
 Claim your right to see the truth
 Though my pangs of conscience,
 Will drill a hole in you

 I seen it coming like a thief in the night,
 I seen it coming from the flash of your light

 So give me strength,
 To face this test tonight

 If only I could turn back time
 If only I had said what I still hide
 If only I could turn back time..
 I would stay for the night

 The bolt reminds me I was there
 The bolt reminds me I was there

 If only I could turn back time
 If only I had said what I still hide
 If only I could turn back time
 I would stay for the night

 [repeat chorus until fades out]
