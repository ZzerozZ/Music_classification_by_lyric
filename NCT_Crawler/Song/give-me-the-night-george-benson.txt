Blues/Jazz|

                        Whenever dark has fallen
 You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
 Until the day is dawning
 You can throw out all the blues and hit the city lights 'Cause there's music in the air
 And lots of lovin' everywhere
 So give me the night
 Give me the night You need the evening action
 A place to dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance
 It's a chain reaction
 We'll see the people of the world coming out to dance 'Cause there's music in the air
 And lots of lovin' everywhere
 So give me the night
 Give me the night So come on out tonight
 And we'll lead the others on a ride through paradise
 And if you feel all right
 Then we can be lovers 'cause I see that starlight look in your eyes
 Well don't you know we can fly? Just give me the night
 Give me the night 'Cause there's music in the air
 And lots of lovin' everywhere
 So give me the night
 Give me the night So come on out tonight
 And we'll lead the others on a ride through paradise
 And if you feel all right
 Then we can be lovers 'cause I see that starlight look in your eyes
 Don't you know we can fly? And if we stay together
 We'll feel the rhythm of the evening taking us up high
 Never mind the weather
 We'll be dancing in the street until the morning light 'Cause there's music in the air
 And lots of lovin' everywhere
 So give me the night
 Give me the night
 Give me the night
 Give me the night
