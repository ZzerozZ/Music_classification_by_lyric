Leona Lewis - Whatever It Takes

Da, da, da, da, da, da, da

People say love
Comes and goes, but
They don't understand
What they don't know
Cause, what I feel starts
Deep inside
It's kinda like a sea
That springs into life
They say it's not right
And we move too fast
But they don't know the meaning
Of what we have
Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
So don't pay no mind
To whatever people say
Whenever it is in my life
Know that I will be on time
'Cause you know why
There's no standing in our way

Da, da, da, da, da, da

When you're far and
We're apart
I'm really missing you
I wanna be where you are

They say it's not right (it's not right)
And it won't last (it won't last)
No point believing
What we have

Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
So don't pay no mind
To whatever people say
Whenever it is in my life
I'll be on time
'Cause you know why
There's no standing in my way

And if you're lost
I'm gonna find you
'Cause without you
I'll break down and cry
And you know why
I wanna surround you
With all my love

Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
So don't pay no mind
To whatever people say
Whenever it is in my life
Know that I will be on time
'Cause you know why
There's no standing in my way

Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
