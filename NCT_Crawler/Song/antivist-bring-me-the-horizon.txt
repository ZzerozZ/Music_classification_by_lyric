                        Middle fingers up if you don't give a ***
 I've seen the devil swallowing
 Every single thing I've said.
 Middle fingers up if you don't give a ***
 You think you're changing anything?
 Quit saying anything The world's in the *** and your children are ***ed
 The ones you think got you are out for your blood
 Well, the lines are blurred and washed out with spite
 So what exactly do you think you're going to change? United we'll fail
 Divided we'll fall
 We're ***ed, but you're making it worse.
 United we'll fail
 Divided we'll fall
 Give up, 'cause you're making it so much worse Middle fingers up if you don't give a ***
 I've seen the devil swallowing
 Every single thing I've said
 Middle fingers up if you don't give a ***
 You think you're changing anything?
 Quit saying anything Give me a break, you deluded arrogant ***
 Self-savvy ***
 If you really believe in the words that you preach
 Get off your seat and onto the street
 There will be no peaceful revolution,
 No war without blood
 You can say I'm just a fool who stands for nothing
 Well for that, I say you're a *** Kick it United we'll fail
 Divided, we'll fall
 United, we'll fail
 We're ***ed, but you're making it worse Middle fingers up if you don't give a ***
 I've seen the devil swallowing
 Every single thing I've said.
 Middle fingers up if you don't give a ***
 You think you're changing anything?
 Quit saying anything.
 Middle fingers up if you don't give a ***
 I've seen the devil swallowing
 Every single thing I've said.
 Middle fingers up if you don't give a ***
 You think you're changing anything?
 Quit saying anything
