                        Hey hey hey
You and me keep on dancing in the dark
It’s been tearing me apart
Never knowing what we are
Hey hey hey
You and me keep on trying to play it cool
Now it’s time to make a move
And that’s what I’m gonna do
Lay it all down
Got something to say
Lay it all down
Throw your doubt away
Do I die now
Step on to the plate
Blow the door wide open like up up and away
Let’s light up the world tonigh-igh-ight
You gotta give up the fight and ri-i-ide
I know that we got the love, alrigh-igh-ight
Come on and ligh-ligh-light it up
Light it up tonight
Let’s light up the world tonigh-igh-ight
You gotta give up the fight and ri-i-ide
I know that we got the love, alrigh-igh-ight
Come on and ligh-ligh-light it up
Light it up tonight
Hey hey hey
You and me turn it up 10000 watts
Tell me why we gotta stop
I just wanna light her up
Hey hey hey
You and me keep on staring at the road
Like we don’t know where to go
Step back, let me take control
Lay it all down
Got something to say
Lay it all down
Throw your doubt away
Do I die now
Step on to the plate
Blow the door wide open like up up and away
Let’s light up the world tonigh-igh-ight
You gotta give up the fight and ri-i-ide
I know that we got the love, alrigh-igh-ight
Come on and ligh-ligh-light it up
Light it up tonight
Let’s light up the world tonigh-igh-ight
You gotta give up the fight and ri-i-ide
I know that we got the love, alrigh-igh-ight
Come on and ligh-ligh-light it up
Light it up tonight
Hey hey hey you
Hey hey hey you
Hey hey hey you
Hey hey hey you you you you you
Lay it all down
Got something to say
Lay it all down
Throw your doubt away
Do I die now
Step on to the plate
Blow the door wide open like up up and away
Let’s light up the world tonigh-igh-ight
You gotta give up the fight and ri-i-ide
I know that we got the love, alrigh-igh-ight
