                        Bài hát: Turn Up The Love - Far East Movement, Cover Drive

We are one tonight
And we breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We turnin' up the love

Turn it up now
Get it poppin', hop the molly
Dirty bass, We so body body
Too legit, we can't quit the party
Super freaks, no Illuminati
So one two hit the booze
We on youtube, nothing to lose
So let it lose 'cause the sheep don't sleep

Like pop pop pop pop
Drop low to the L O
V E gotta get more
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give
Turn it up
Turned up you don't hear me no
Here's some love for your stereo
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give

We are one tonight
And we breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We turnin' up the love

We are one tonight
And we breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We turnin' up the love

Go ahead now flos your love like a heart of gold
Dirty bass to bake a tussy roll
If you don't low on the floor
I got a crew that will handle that cookie jar
Damn girl, I ain't tryin' to be rude
Spread love like a guest list you plus two
That's what you call a move

Like pop pop pop pop
Drop low to the L O
V E gotta get more
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give
Turn it up
Turned up you don't hear me no
Here's a love for your stereo
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
Like pop pop pop pop

Turn me on like this your song
Dirty bass got love to give
Turn it up now
Mad monopoly all night long
Dirty bass got love to give
Yo, let me see that grill from here to here
So much love in the atmosphere
The good times roll with me right here
I got nothing but love to give

We are one tonight
And we breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We turnin' up the love

We are one tonight
And we breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We turnin' up the love

Turn it up now
Turn it up now
Dirty bass got
Love to give
Love to give
Like pop pop pop pop
