                        What would I give
 To live where you are?
 What would I pay
 To stay here beside you?
 What would I do to see you
 Smiling at me? Where would we walk?
 Where would we run?
 If we could stay all day in the sun?
 Just you and me
 And I could be
 Part of your world I don't know when
 I don't know how
 But I know something's starting right now
 Watch and you'll see
 Some day I'll be
 Part of your world
                        
                    |
