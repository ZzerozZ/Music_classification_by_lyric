                        You got a smile so bright
 You know you could have been a candle
 I'm holding you so tight
 You know you could have been a handle
 The way you swept me off my feet
 You know you could've been a broom
 And babe you smell so sweet
 You know you could've been some perfume

 [Chorus:]

 Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
 I can tell
 The way you do the things you do... Alright
 The way you do the thing's you do

 As pretty as you are
 You know you could've been a flower
 If good looks were minutes
 You know you could have been an hour
 The way you stole my heart
 You know you could have been a crook
 And baby your so smart
 You know you could have been a school book

 [Chorus:]

 Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
 I can tell
 The way you do the thing's you do... Alright
 The way you do the thing's you do

 You make my life so rich
 You know you could've been some money
 And baby you're so sweet
 You know you could have been some honey

 [Chorus:]

 Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
 I can tell
 The way you do the thing's you do... Alright
 The way you do the thing's you do

 As pretty as you are
 You know you could've been a flower
 If good looks were minutes
 You know you could have been an hour
 The way you stole my heart
 You know you could have been a crook
 And baby your so smart
 You know you could have been a school book

 [Chorus:]

 Well you could of been any thing that you wanted to
 I can tell
 The way you do the thing's you do... Alright
 The way you do the thing's you do
                        
                    |
