                        Bài hát: When You're Looking Like That (Live At Croke Park) - Westlife

When you're looking like that
Yeah yeah

She's a 5 foot 10 in catsuit and Bambi eyes
Everybody's who's staring
Wouldn't believe that this girl was mine
I should have known I was wrong
When I left her for a life in pity
But they say you never miss the water until it's gone, yeah

Guess I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?

She's all dressed up for glamor and rock and roll
Wanna squeeze her real tight, get out of this place
If only I could take control
But she is out of my reach forever
And just a week ago she lied next to me
It's so ironic how I had to lose just to see

That I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?

I don't wanna forget you
I don't even wanna try
How am I supposed to walk on by
When you're looking like that?

How am I supposed to leave you?
I can't believe what I just gave away
'Cause I can't take it back, I'm lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?

How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?

How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that
