                        Oh, hey
 Yeah I've been wanderin' 'round in the dark
 Been lost somewhere where no
 Light could shine on my heart
 I have known a pain so deep
 But I know my faith will free me Get there and I'll get through this
 Get there I'll find my way again
 So don't tell me that it's over
 'Cause each step just gets me closer I will get there, I will get there
 I will get there, I will get there somehow
 Cross that river, cross that river
 Nothings stoppin' me now, I will get through the night
 And make it through to the other side
 Get there, get there, get there, get there I've been in these chains for so long
 I'll break free and I'll be there where I belong
 Hold my head up high, I'll stand tall
 And I swear this time I won't fall Get there I will do this
 Get there no matter what it takes
 'Cause I know no limitations
 And I'll reach my destination, I will get there I will get there, I will get there
 I will get there somehow, somehow
 Cross that river, cross that river
 Nothings stoppin' me now, I will get through the night
 And make it through to the other side
 Oh, get there, get there, get there, get there Well, the night is cold and dark
 But somewhere the sun is shining
 And I'll feel it shine on me
 I'll keep tryin', I'll keep tryin' I will get there, I will get there
 I will get there somehow
 Cross that river, I'm gonna cross that river
 Nothings stoppin' me now, I will get through the night
 And make it through to the other side
 Get there, get there, get there, get there I will get there, I will get there
 I will get there somehow, somehow
 Cross that river, I'll cross that river for you
 Nothings stoppin' me now, I will get through the night
 And make it through to the other side
 Get there, get there, get there, get there I'll get there
                        
                    |
