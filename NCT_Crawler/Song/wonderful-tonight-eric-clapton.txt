                        It's late in the evening 
She's wondering what clothes to wear 
She puts on her make up 
And brushes her long blonde hair 
And then she asks me 
Do I look alright 
And I say yes, you look wonderful tonight 
We go to a party 
And everyone turns to see 
This beautiful lady 
That's walking around with me 
And then she asks me 
Do you feel alright 
And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight 

I feel wonderful 
Because I see the love light in your eyes 
And the wonder of it all 
Is that you just don't realize 
How much I love you 

It's time to go home now 
And I've got an aching head 
So I give her the car keys 
She helps me to bed 
And then I tell her 
As I turn out the light 
I say my darling, you were wonderful tonight 
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight
                        
                    |
