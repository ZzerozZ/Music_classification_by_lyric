                        Bài hát: I Just Can't Wait To Be King (The Lion King) - Disney

I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!

I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair

I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar

Thus far a rather uninspiring thing

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

No one saying do this Now when I said that--
No one saying be there What I meant was--
No one saying stop that What you don't realize--
No one saying see here Now see here!
Free to run around all day That's definitely out--
Free to do it all my way!

I think it's time that you and I
Arranged a heart-to-heart

Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start

If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Everybody look left

Everybody look right

Everywhere you look I'm--

Standing in the spotlight

Not yet

Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

Oh, he just can't wait to be king!

Oh, I just can't wait...

Just can't wait
                        
                    |
