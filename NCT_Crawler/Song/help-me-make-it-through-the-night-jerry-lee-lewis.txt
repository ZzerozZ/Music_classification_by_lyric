                        Take the ribbon from your hair shake it loose and let it fall
 Laying soft upon my skin like the shadows on the wall
 Come on and lay down by my side till the early morning light
 All I'm taking is your time just help me make it through the night I don't care what's right or wrong I don't try to understand
 Let the devil take tomorrow Lord tonight I need a friend
 Well, yesterday is dead and gone yes it is
 And tomorrow's out of sight, it's so sad to be alone
 (Think about it now)
 Help me make it through the night I don't care what's right or wrong
