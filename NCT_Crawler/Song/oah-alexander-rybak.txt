                        Bài hát: Oah - Alexander Rybak

Singing oah
I love you Moa
You’re way to young for me
But I don’t mind

Never mind what your girlfriends say
Deep inside I’m quite okay
I may have fooled around once or twice
But I really need you
It’s not like I’m the only guy
O I know how you make them cry
So let’s start by being friends
And let this friendship never end

I knew you years ago
What I was
I don’t know
But let’s just take it slow

Singing Oah
I love you Moa
You’re way to young for me
But I don’t mind
Don’t say maybe
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
Cuz you’ll be fine

So tell me what I want to hear
No way that you slided there
You know I’m not good for you
God I don’t now what to do

I liked you from the start
You melt my icy heart
And now it’s burning up

Singing Oah
I love you Moa
You’re way to young for me
But I don’t mind
Don’t say maybe
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
Cuz you’ll be fine

Don’t go away
No one is left to me
I was reliefd that you would save my soul
But if you slow me down
Crying secretly
Would you hold my hand and never let it gooooo?

I’m singing oah
Cuz I love you Moa
You’re way to young for me
But I don’t mind
Don’t say may be
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
Cuz you’ll be fine

I ́m Singin oah
Cuz I love you Moa
You’re way to you young for me
But I don’t mind
Don't say maybe
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
Cuz you'll be fine
Send "Oah" Ringtone to your Cell
