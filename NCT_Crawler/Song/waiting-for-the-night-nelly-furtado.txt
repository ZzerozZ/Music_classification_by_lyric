                        LYRICS:
Baby I know you're outside 
In here it's warm and dry 
Got feelings that I've got to try expressing 
Like a language that I share with you 
Let's talk in the special way we do 
Don't want to be anywhere else but here with you 
Feels so good 

Day and night, day and night 
You blow my mind, blow my mind 
And I can't help, help myself at all 
I can't hold back 
Day and night, day and night 
You blow my mind, blow my mind 
And I can't help, help myself from falling 
So I'm waiting for the night 

Baby I know it's late 
We've got decisions to make 
Think of what we could create together 
And with you I am never afraid 
To play with the highest stakes 
Nobody could break my rapture 

Day and night, day and night 
You blow my mind, blow my mind 
And I can't help, help myself at all 
I can't hold back 
Day and night, day and night 
You blow my mind, blow my mind 
And I can't help, help myself from falling 
So I'm waiting for the night 

I can't control it in the night, night, night 
It's when I've got you on my mind, mind, mind 
Cuz you're the twinkle in my eye, eye, eye 
I've got to get you in my life, life, life 
Can't think of nothing worse than being lonely 
I think you're the right choice for one and only 
We're running out of time so baby hold me 
Days go by 

Day and night, day and night 
You blow my mind, blow my mind 
And I can't help, help myself at all 
I can't hold back 
Day and night, day and night 
You blow my mind, blow my mind 
And I can't help, help myself from falling 
So I'm waiting for the night 

I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting 
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting 
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting 
So I'm waiting for the night 
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting 
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting 
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting 
So I'm waiting for the night 
Yeah, I really want to see you yeah 
Yeah, I really want to see you yeah 
I really want to see you tonight 
Yeah, I really want to see you yeah 
Don't keep me waiting waiting, don't keep me waiting for the night 
Don't keep me waiting waiting, don't keep me waiting for the night 
Waiting for the night
