                        [Chris Brown]
Where you been? Where you been all my life?
Girl you glistening, the way you look in the light
It’s obvious that I want something from you
You know what, what I wanna do, do, do
Every time it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
what it’ll be like
Oh, everytime, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it’d be like
What it’d be like
What it’d be like, like, like
What it’d be like, like, like....

[Lil Wayne]
I saw you from afar
Thought I’d say “wassup”
You can tell me your name, when we breaking up
Call me Tunechi, I’m good, I’m Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye: smooches
You’re a beast, yo-your a beauty
Man I bet somebody dunn gave Cupid an Uzi: shoot me
You’re a firework, biter in the dark
So lets turn off the lights and give me that spark

Every time it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it’d be like
Oh every time it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
what it’d be like
what it’d be like
what it’d be like, like, like
what it’d be like, like, like

I want to let her touch me
One touch will feel free
I want to feel free
She can kiss me
So I can finally be
So I can finally see
So I can finally see
