                        Bài hát: Turn Me On - Norah Jones

Like a flower waiting to bloom 
Like a lightbulb in a dark room 
I'm just sitting here waiting for you 
To come on home and turn me on 

Like the desert waiting for the rain 
Like a school kid waiting for the spring 
Im just sitting here waiting for you 
To come on home and turn me on 

My poor heart it's been so dark 
Since you've been gone 
After all you're the one who turns me off 
You're the only one who can turn me back on 

My hi-fi is waiting for a new tune 
My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes 
I'm just sitting here waiting for you 
To come on home and turn me on 
Turn me on
                        
                    |
