                        Don't gamble with love
 It's only for fools
 So play by the rules
 Don't gamble with love Oh, don't gamble with love
 You'll lose it for sure
 There'll be no cure
 When you gamble with love You can gamble your house, gamble your car
 Gamble your hopes, just as far
 As the stars up above
 Why don't you gamble with love Oh, don't gamble with love
 It's only for fools
 So play by the rules
 Don't gamble with love Oh, don't gamble with love
 It's only for fools
 So play by the rules
 Don't gamble with love Don't gamble with love
 Don't gamble with love
 Don't gamble with love
