                        I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh
 I want to hold you high and steal your pain away
 I keep your photograph, and I know it serves me well
 I want to hold you high and steal your pain 'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
 And I don't feel right when you've gone away
 You've gone away,
 You don't feel me here anymore The worst is over now and we can breathe again
 I want to hold you high, and steal my pain away
 There's so much left to learn, and no one left to fight
 I want to hold you high and steal your pain 'Cause I'm broken when I'm open
 And I don't feel like I am strong enough
 'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
 And I don't feel right when you're gone away 'Cause I'm broken when I'm open
 And I don't feel like I am strong enough
 'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
 And I don't feel right when you're gone away 'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
 And I don't feel right when you're gone away
 You've gone away,
 You don't feel me here anymore
