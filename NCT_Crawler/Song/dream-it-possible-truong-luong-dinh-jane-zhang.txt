                        Bài hát: Dream It Possible - Jane Zhang (Trương Lương Dĩnh)

I will run, I will climb, I will soar
I'm undefeated.. Oo
Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord
Yeah I believe it
The past, is everything we were
Don't make us who we are
So I'll dream, until I make it real
And all I see is stars
It's not until you fall that you fly
When your dreams come
Alive you're unstoppable
Take a shot, chase the
Sun, find the beautiful
We will glow in the dark
Turning dust to gold
And we'll dream
It possible
Possible
And we'll dream
It possible
I will chase, I will reach, I will fly
Until I'm breaking, until I'm breaking
Out of my cage, like a bird in the night
I know I'm changing, I know I'm changing
In, into something big,
Better than before
And if it takes, takes a thousand lives
Then it's worth fighting for

It's not until you fall that you fly
When your dreams come
Alive you're unstoppable
Take a shot, chase the
Sun, find the beautiful
We will glow in the dark
Turning dust to gold
And we'll dream
It possible
Possible
From the bottom to the top
We're sparking wild fire's
Never quit and never stop
The rest of our lives
From the bottom to the top
We're sparking wild fire's
Never quit and never stop
It's not until you fall that you fly
When your dreams come
Alive you're unstoppable
Take a shot, chase the
Sun, find the beautiful
We will glow in the dark
Turning dust to gold
And we'll dream
It possible
Possible
And we'll dream
It possible
