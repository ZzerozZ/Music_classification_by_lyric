                        My lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?
 I'll wake you tomorrow
 And you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill My lady D'Arbanville, why does it grieve me so?
 But your heart seems so silent
 Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low? My lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?
 I'll wake you tomorrow
 And you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill My lady D'Arbanville, you look so cold tonight
 Your lips feel like winter
 Your skin has turned to white, your skin has turned to white My lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?
 I'll wake you tomorrow
 And you will be my fill My lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?
 I'll wake you tomorrow
 And you will be my fill I loved you my lady, though in your grave you lie
 I'll always be with you
 This rose will never die, this rose will never die I loved you my lady, though in your grave you lie
 I'll always be with you
 This rose will never die, this rose will never die
