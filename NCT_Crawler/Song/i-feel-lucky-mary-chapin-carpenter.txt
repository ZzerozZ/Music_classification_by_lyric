                        Well, I woke up this morning, stumbled out of my rack
 I opened up the paper to the page in the back
 It only took a minute for my finger to find
 My daily dose of destiny under my sign My eyes just about popped out of my head
 It said, "The stars are stacked against you girl, get back in bed" I feel lucky, I feel lucky, yeah
 No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way
 Mmm, I feel lucky today Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk
 The pot's eleven million so I called in sick to work
 I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's
 Crossed against the light, made a beeline for the park The sky began to thunder, wind began to moan
 I heard a voice above me saying, "Girl, you better get back home" But I feel lucky, oh, oh, oh, I feel lucky, yeah
 No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away
 Mmm, I feel lucky today Now eleven million later, I was sitting at the bar
 I'd bought the house a double and the waitress a new car
 Dwight Yoakam's in the corner trying to catch my eye
 Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true
 Hey the stars might lie but the numbers never do I feel lucky, oh, oh, oh, I feel lucky, yeah
 Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight
 Hot dog, I'm feeling lucky tonight I feel lucky, brr, I feel lucky, yeah
 Think I'll flip a coin, I'm a winner either way
 Mmm, I feel lucky today
