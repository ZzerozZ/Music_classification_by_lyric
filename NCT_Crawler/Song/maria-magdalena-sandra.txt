                        Bài hát: Maria Magdalena - Sandra

You take my love 
You want my soul 
I would be crazy to share your life 
Why can't you see what I am 
Sharpen the senses and turn the knife 
Hurt me and you'll understand 

I'll never be Maria Magdalena 
(You're a creature of the night) 
Maria Magdalena 
(you're a victim of the fight) 
(you need love) 
Promise me delight 
(You need love) 

Why must I lie 
Find alibis 
When will you wake up and realize 
I can't surrender to you 
Play for affection and 
Win the prize 
I know those party games too 

I'll never be Maria Magdalena 
(You're a creature of the night) 
Maria Magdalena 
(you're a victim of the fight) 
(you need love) 
Promise me delight 
(You need love)
                        
                    |
