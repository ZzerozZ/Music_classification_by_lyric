                        Bài hát: Smoke Signals - James Blunt

One by one they pass me by
And I've used up my supplies
Out of water, out of hope
Can't make fire, only smoke

Here I am alone in silence
Castaway on a desert island
A traveller in an ocean lost at sea

Smoke signals in the night sky
Hope you see them as you pass by
I'm screaming from the cliff top
You're the only one I've got to rescue me, to rescue me
Why can't you see? Why can't you see?
I don't think that I'll survive
I'll die here without you
Oh, I can't live without you

The sun comes up, the sun goes down
Wonder if I'll ever be found?

Here I am alone in silence
Castaway on a desert island
A traveller in an ocean lost at sea

Smoke signals in the night sky
Hope you see them as you pass by
I'm screaming from the cliff top
You're the only one I've got to rescue me, to rescue me
Why can't you see? Why can't you see?
I don't think that I'll survive
I'll die here without you
Oh, I can't live without you

Smoke signals in the night sky
Hope you see them as you pass by
I'm screaming from the cliff top
You're the only one I've got to rescue me, to rescue me
Why can't you see? Why can't you see?
I don't think that I'll survive
I'll die here without you
Oh, I can't live without you
                        
                    |
