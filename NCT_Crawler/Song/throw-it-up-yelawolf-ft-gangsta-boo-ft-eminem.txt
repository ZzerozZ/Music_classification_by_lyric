                        [Gangsta Boo - Hook]
 I see you bitches talking loud but you aint saying ***
 Get the f-ck from round here, you don't rep my ***
 You aint from my city, you don't know about this
 You don't want that drama you aint ready for it bitch
 Now throw it up, (yeah hoe) throw it up (yeah hoe)
 Throw it up (yeah hoe) throw it up
 You aint ready for it bitch, throw it up
 (Yeah hoe) throw it up
 You aint ready for it bitch [Yelawolf]
 I already got 2 cars on the yard that don't run
 So why would I wanna break *** down for you
 Better be confused with the punchlines and bars that I launch
 Here the king of archery come, with a cracker dick
 To f-ck you and that p-ssy carpet you munch
 If I'm not hardly the one, you must be barely the one
 Baby really, you kidding me, bitch I'm the prodigal son
 And I'm stuntin like my daddy
 d-dr-d-drinkin' like my mama
 Country like my uncles, stuttering like a CD in a DONK bump bump bump
 And I'm in a blue Chevy, running over mutha***as in first
 I aint even shift gears yet, I aint even here yet
 I'm outta this earth, right (yeah hoe)
 But I just hit the surface
 And I'm bout to walk into a bank with a shank and black can of paint and check the clerk
 Where the keys?
 Bitch you better check your purse
 I gotta break up herb, gotta hit this syrup and I'm feeling like I might just hit the curb
 So get the *** outta my way, buddy you don't wanna run around the chicken house with the heart of a puppy dog Yelawolf and Eminem, shiiit!
 Suckering suckatash, yeah suck a dick bitch [Hook] [Gangsta Boo - Verse 2]
 Bitch please you don't wanna step up to this misses
 G-A-N-G-S-T-A Boo, make a nigga hit his knees when
 I'm up in the building, preaching to my children
 I don't be taking no *** from you haters
 You make me hurt one of your feelings
 hahahahaha, Na-nani-nah-nah
 Pick ya face up off the floor, I got you feeling sad now
 You be on that hoki wag, hoki wag? is bull***
 Run into this gangsta have ya preacher at the pulpit
 Bitch, I was born on the Mississippi river
 Take no *** from a bitch or a nigga
 So so crazy got a f-cked up temper
 Bi-polar, not Nicki I'm worser
 I'll hurt ya
 I got a crazy ass mind game
 My nigga, I'm a lion untamed
 Hunt ya ass down in my jungle
 I do this, I tell them hoes
 You aint ready for it bitch [Hook] [Eminem - Verse 3]
 Me an' Yelawolf tear the roof off this muthaf-cka
 You aint got the umph, you're a hoof, to the foot of an elephant
 Hello toots you look so eloquent, it's what I tell a ***
 Come sit up front cause you kicking my seat and I'm tryna tell the cashier what I want
 They say I act like an ***
 When I pull up at the White Castle
 And I ask for an application, throw it back in her face an'
 Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her in the head with a Whopper
 That I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper?
 Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately, SLUT, HOE
 Skidda di da da. Prada? Nada chance
 I was thinkin' about buying you some clothes
 But Target was closed so I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart
 But the doors was, was locked, what about some shoes I thought
 Great I suppose, so I go to Payless but what'dya know
 They don't carry a size 8 in HOES! Oh!
 This is ugly boy swag, puttin' toe tags on you muthaf-ckin' hoe bags
 What a trailer trash pioneer?
 I am here, that's why I'm here
 I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a muthaf-ckin' diary of diarrhea!
 Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two about sign language
 Middle fingers aimed at you so we don't gotta SCREAM AT YOU!
 Oww! I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident
 I went to go tell 'em all to go get BUCKED
 But I'm not gonna bite my tongue, little bitch throw it up [Hook]
