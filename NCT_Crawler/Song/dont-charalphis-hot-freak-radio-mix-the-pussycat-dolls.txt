 Ok (ahh)
 Yeah (ahh)
 Oh, we about to get it just a lil hot and sweaty in this mu'fucka (oh, baby)
 Ladies let's go (uhh)
 Soldiers let's go (dolls)
 Let me talk to y'all and just you know
 Give you a little situation... Listen (fellas)

 [Buster Rhymes]
 Pussycat Dolls
 Ya see this *** get hot
 Every time I come through when I step up in the spot (are you ready)
 Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
 Prowl for the best chick
 Yes I'm on the lookout (let's dance)
 Slow banging shorty like a belly dancer with it
 Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta with it (oh, baby)
 No tricks only diamonds under my sleeve
 Gimme the number
 But make sure you call before you leave

 [Pussycat Dolls]
 I know you like me (I know you like me)
 I know you do (I know you do)
 That's why whenever I come around
 She's all over you (she's all over you)
 I know you want it (I know you want it)
 It's easy to see (it's easy to see)
 And in the back of your mind
 I know you should be on with me (babe)

 [Chorus:]
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
 Don't cha?
 Don't cha?
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was wrong like me?
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
 Don't cha?
 Don't cha?

 Fight the feeling (fight the feeling)
 Leave it alone (leave it alone)
 'Cause if it ain't love
 It just ain't enough to leave my happy home (my happy home)
 Let's keep it friendly (let's keep it friendly)
 You have to play fair (you have to play fair)
 See I don't care
 But I know she ain't gonna wanna share

 [Chorus:]
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
 Don't cha?
 Don't cha?
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was wrong like me?
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
 Don't cha?
 Don't cha?

 [Busta Rhymes]
 Ok, I see how it's goin' down (ahh, don't cha)
 Seems like shorty wanna little menage pop off or something (let's go)
 Well let me get straight to it
 Every broad wan watch a nigga when I come through it
 It's the god almighty, looking all brand new
 If shorty wanna jump in my ass then vanquish
 Looking at me all like she really wanna do it
 Tryna put it on me till my balls black an blueish
 Ya wanna play wit ah playa girl then play on
 Strip out the Chanel
 And leave the lingerie on
 Watch me and I'mma watch you at the same time
 Looking at ya wan break my back
 You're the very reason why I keep a pack ah the Magnum
 An wit the wagon hit chu in the back of tha magnum
 For the record, don't think it was something you did
 Shorty all on me cause it's hard to resist the kid
 I got a idea that's dope for y'all
 As y'all could get so I could hit the both of y'all

 [Pussycat Dolls]
 I know she loves you (I know she loves you)
 I understand (I understand)
 I'd probably be just as crazy about you
 If you were my own man
 Maybe next lifetime (maybe next lifetime)
 Possibly (possibly)
 Until then old friend
 Your secret is safe with me

 [Chorus:]
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
 Don't cha?
 Don't cha?
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was wrong like me?
 Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
 Don't cha?
 Don't cha?
