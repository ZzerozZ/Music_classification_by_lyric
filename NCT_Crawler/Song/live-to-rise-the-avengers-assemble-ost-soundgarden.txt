                        Bài hát: Live To Rise (The Avengers Assemble Ost) - Soundgarden

What if all you understand
Could fit into the center of our hand?
Then you found it wasn't you
Who held the sum of everything you knew

We're insane but not alone,
You hold on and let go

Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die and then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise again

What if the one thing that I missed
Was everything I need to pass the test?
And if I fail what happens then?
Can I still count on you as a friend?

We're insane but not alone,
You hold on and let go

Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die and then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise again, again, again, again.

Warm my face
Warm your face
Warm my face
Warm your face
Warm my face
Warm your face
Warm my face
Warm your face
Warm my face
Warm your face

Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die and then ignite again

Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die and then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise again, again.
