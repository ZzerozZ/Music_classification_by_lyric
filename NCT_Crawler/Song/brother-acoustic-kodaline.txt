                        Bài hát: Brother (Acoustic) - Kodaline

When we were young
We were the ones
The kings and queens
Oh yeah, we ruled the world
We smoked cigarettes
Man no regrets
Wish I could relive
Every single word (brother)

We’ve taken different paths
And travelled different roads
I know we’ll always end up on the same one when we’re old
And when you’re in the trenches
And you’re under fire I will cover you.

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I’d give you my lungs so you could breathe.

I’ve got you brother-er-er-er. (x4)

Oh brother, we’ll go deeper than the ink
Beneath the skin of our tattoos
Though we don’t share the same blood
You’re my brother and I love you
That’s the truth.

We’re living different lives
Heaven only knows

If we’ll make it back
With all our fingers and our toes
5 years, 20 years, come back
It will always be the same.

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I would give you my lungs so you could breathe.

I’ve got you brotheeer-er-er-er. (x2)

And if we hit on troubled water
I’ll be the one to keep you warm and safe
And we’ll be carrying each other
Until we say goodbye on our dying day.

Because I’ve got you brother-er-er-er
I’ve got you brotheeer-er-er-er
I’ve got you brotheeer-er-er-er
I’ve got you brotheeer-er-er-er.

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I would give you my lungs so you could breathe.

I’ve got you brother-er-er-errr. (x2)
