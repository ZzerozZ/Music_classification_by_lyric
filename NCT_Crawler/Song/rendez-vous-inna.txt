                        Bài hát: Rendez Vous - Inna

(One, two, three, four) 
Met you in the water, oh, oh 
Swimming in the shadow of my heart 

Went a little deeper, oh, oh
I knew that we were perfect from the sta-a-art

Oh baby, me and you
We're gonna have a little rendez vous
We're gonna keep it a menage a deux
The way you loved me, gave me deja vu

When I get the feeling real in the summer
You can come and meet me, we can fall in love
Take me to the sea, take me to the sun
Just a little secret, no one needs to know

Oh, rendez vous
Oh, rendez vous

Temperature is rising, oh, oh
You're the only one to cool me down
You're my hidden treasure on the shore
You know you're the best thing that I've found

Oh baby, me and you
We're gonna have a little rendez vous
We're gonna keep it a menage a deux
The way you loved me, gave me deja vu

When I get the feeling real in the summer
You can come and meet me, we can fall in love
Take me to the sea, take me to the sun
Just a little secret, no one needs to know

Oh, rendez vous
Oh, rendez vous

I hear your body, I hear it calling
I move to the rhythm of you
Cause you know exactly what to do

Oh, rendez vous
Oh, rendez vous

When I get the feeling
When I get the feeling
When I get the feeling
When I get the feeling
No one needs to know
Oh, rendez vous.
