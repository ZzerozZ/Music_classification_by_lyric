                        Bài hát: Long Long Way - Damien Rice

Long long way to the top
Long way down if you fall
And it's a long way back if you get lost

Long way out to the end
Long way to go to lose your friends
It's a long way to haul all the traps you've trawled
When you could just stop and let go

But you say
"Not now, maybe later...
But not now, maybe later...
Not now, maybe later..."
(You're only in your way)
"But not now, maybe later..."
(You're only in your way)
"Not now, maybe later..."
(You're only in your way)
"But not now, maybe later..."
(You're only in your way)
"But not now, maybe... wait..."
(You're only in your way)

'Cause love is tough
When enough is not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough...
