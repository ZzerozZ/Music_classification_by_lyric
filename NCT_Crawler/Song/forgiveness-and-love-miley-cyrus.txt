                        Imagining you're far away
 Searching for the words to say
 I feel it when you fall apart
 Our lives are a greatest art I don't wanna change your mind
 'Cause I accept you for
 Everything you are
 And will be stay here with me now, ah The only thing that our hearts are made of
 Are the acts of forgiveness and love
 The only thing real when push comes to shove
 Are the acts of forgiveness and love 'Cause in the end no one loses or wins
 The story begins again and again
 With forgiveness and love You don't ever have to read my mind
 You can see it when you close your eyes
 Don't believe it when you lose your fate
 Another moment is a moment away I can't tell you what the future holds
 Or how to live
 All I know is what feels right
 lights up my life again and again The only thing that our hearts are made of
 Are the acts of forgiveness and love
 The only thing real when push comes to shove
 Are the acts of forgiveness and love 'Cause in the end no one loses or wins
 The story begins again and again
 With forgiveness and love Let's jump the sun
 Let's find forever
 Where does the time go? Just live your life
 You'll get another today, today, today
 Forgiveness and love 'Cause in the end no one loses or wins
 The story begins again and again
 With forgiveness and love Let's jump the sun
 Let's jump the sun
 Let's jump the sun
 Forgiveness and love
