                        Now I know how to get down on the floor
 Experience the moves you can't ignore
 But something 'bout this beat just got me hooked
 Come over here and take a closer look 'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
 I can't stay on the ground (whoa)
 I can't get enough, I can't get enough
 This is taking me now It's taking me higher, higher
 Higher off the ground
 It's taking me higher, higher
 Higher off the ground I do this just for kicks,
 Just for the thrill,
 I got this high, without taking a pill
 This groove has got me way over the sun
 I'm dancing like I am the only one 'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
 I can't stay on the ground (whoa)
 I can't get enough, I can't get enough
 This is taking me now It's taking me higher, higher
 Higher off the ground
 It's taking me higher, higher
 Higher off the ground The music's got me going higher
 I feel like I can touch the sky It's taking me higher, higher
 Higher off the ground
 It's taking me higher, higher
 Higher off the ground
 It's taking me higher, higher
 Higher off the ground
 It's taking me higher, higher
 Higher off the ground
