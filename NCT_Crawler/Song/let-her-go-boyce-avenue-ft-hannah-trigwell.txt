                        Only need the light when it's burning low 
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
You only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go 

Now staring at the bottom of your glass 
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last 
But dreams come slow and they go so fast 

And you see her when you close your eyes 
Maybe one day you'll understand why 
Everything you touch surely dies 

But you only need the light when it's burning low 
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
You only know you love her when you let her go 
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low 
Only hate the road when you're missing home 
Only know you love her when you let her go 

Staring at the ceiling in the dark 
Same old empty feeling in your heart 
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast 
Well you see her when you fall asleep 
But never to touch, no never to keep 
'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep 

But you only need the light when it's burning low 
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
You only know you love her when you let her go 
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low 
Only hate the road when you're missing home 
Only know you love her when you let her go 
And you let her go 
Uh uh
You let her go 
Uh uh 

You only need the light when it's burning low 
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
You only know you love her when you let her go 
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low 
Only hate the road when you're missing home 
Only know you love her when you let her go 

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low 
Only hate the road when you're missing home 
Only know you love her when you let her go 
And you let her go
                        
                    |
