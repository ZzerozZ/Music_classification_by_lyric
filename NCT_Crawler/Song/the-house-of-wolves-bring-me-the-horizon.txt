                        Show me a sign, show me a reason to give
 A solitary *** about your god damn beliefs
 I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
 Death is the only salvation you'll fear Brick by brick by brick
 Brick by brick by brick What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse
 Cloak and daggers murder the truth
 The bitter taste, there's nothing else
 I'll bow for your king when he shows himself Brick by brick by brick
 These walls begin to cave in
 The house of wolves you built
 Is burning a thousand times Show me your face, show me a reason to think,
 My soul can be saved if I sell you my sins
 I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
 Death is the only salvation for me Brick by brick by brick
 These walls begin to cave in
 The house of wolves you built
 Is burning a thousand times (The wolves you built) (the wolves you built)
 (The nest of wolves you built)
 The house of wolves you built
 Will burn just like a thousand suns And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
 Is 2 foot wide and 6 foot deep And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
 Is two foot wide and six foot deep
 And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
 Is two foot wide and six foot deep Brick by brick by brick
 Brick by brick by brick
 Brick by brick by brick
 These walls begin to cave in
 The house of wolves you built
 Is burning a thousand times Brick by brick by brick
 These walls begin to cave in
 The house of wolves you built
 Will burn just like a thousand suns You said you want me
 Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here
 You said you want me
 Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here
