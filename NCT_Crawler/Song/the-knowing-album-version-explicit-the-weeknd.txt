                        I know... What you did
 I know
 So I'mma let you... Taste her
 I ain't washing my sins
 I ain't washing my sins

 Now we're lying about the nights
 Hiding it all behind the smiles
 Take a look at what you did
 (Ayyyyy)
 You probably thought that you'd break my heart (Ooooohoooh)
 You probably thought that you'd make me cry
 But baby it's okay
 I swear it's okay

 Cause I know everything
 I know everything
 I know everything
 I know everything
 I know everything
 I know everything
 I know everything
 I know everything

 Now these tongues don't twist like they did before
 It's hard to keep me up
 And you are dry
 But baby it don't hurt
 Oh, like you thought it would
 The more of you the merrier

 Now we're lying about the nights
 Hiding it all behind the smiles
 Take a look at what you did
 You probably thought that you'd break my heart
 You probably thought that you'd make me cry
 But baby it's okay
 I swear it's okay

 I know everything (Ayyyy, Yeaaaah)
 I know everything (aaayyyyy)
 I know everything
 I know everything
