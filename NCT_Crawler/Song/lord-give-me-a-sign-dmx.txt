                        Yeah, in the name of Jesus, spread the word
 No weapon formed against me shall prosper
 And every turn that rise against my judgment
 Thou shall condemn, Lord, give me a sign For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord
 "And their righteousness is of me," said the Lord
 Amen, Lord, give me a sign I really need talk to You, Lord
 Since the last time we talked, the walk has been hard
 Now I know You haven't left me but I feel like I'm alone
 I'ma big boy now but I'm still not grown And I'm still goin' through it, pain and the hurt
 Soakin' up trouble like rain in the dirt
 And I know, only I can stop the rain
 With just the mention of my Savior's name
 In the name of Jesus Devil, I rebuke you for what I go through
 You been tryna make me do what I used to
 But all that stops right here
 As long as the Lord's in my life, I will have no fear I will know no pain, from the light to the dark
 I will no show no shame, spit it right from the heart
 'Cause it's right from the start, you held me down
 And ain't nothin' they can tell me now Lord, give me a sign
 Let me know what's on Your mind
 Let me know what I'm gon' find
 It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
 Show me how to reach the blind Lord, give me a sign
 Show me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to You
 As I'ma go through whatever You want me to
 Just let me know what to do
 Lord, give me a sign Please, show me some'n
 I'm tired talkin' to him, knowin' he frontin'
 Cryin' 'bout, "Life ain't nothin'"
 But you either be the one mad
 'Cause you trapped or the one huntin' Trapped in yo' own mind, waitin' on the Lord
 Or huntin' with the word that cuts like a sword
 The spoken word is stronger than the strongest man
 Carries the whole world like the strongest hand Through the trials and tribulations, You never let us down
 Jesus, I know You're here with us now
 Jesus, I know You're still with us now
 Keep it real with us now, I wanna feel, show me how Please, let me take Your hand, guide me
 I'll walk slow but stay right beside me
 Devil's tryna find me
 Hide me, hold up, I take that back
 Protect me and give me the strength to fight back Lord, give me a sign
 Let me know what's on Your mind
 Let me know what I'm gon' find
 It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
 Show me how to reach the blind Lord, give me a sign
 Show me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to You
 As I'ma go through whatever You want me to
 Just let me know what to do
 Lord, give me a sign Life or death, live or die
 I will never live a lie
 I'm gon' get because I try
 I won't quit until I die I'm gon' make it, wrong or right
 And make it through the darkest time
 And when the morning comes, you'll see
 That all I have is God in me
 Lord, give me a sign No weapon formed against me shall prosper
 Lord, give me a sign
 For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord
 In the name of Jesus Lord, give me a sign
 Let me know what's on Your mind
 Let me know what I'm gon' find
 It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
 Show me how to reach the blind Lord, give me a sign
 Show me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to You
 As I'ma go through whatever You want me to
 Just let me know what to do
 Lord, give me a sign
