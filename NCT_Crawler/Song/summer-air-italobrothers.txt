Let's go back (let's go now)
Let's go back (let's go now)

Okay, I was drunk as hell
Okay, but so were you
The same flight, same row
The same hotel
That sounds fake, but this is the truth

Why don't we just go back
Back to where we came from?
The summer air
The summer air
Why don't we just go back
Back to where we came from?
The summer air
The summer air

Let's go back
Let's go now
Let's go back
Let's go now
Let's go back
Let's go now
Let's go back
Let's go now
The summer air
The summer air

Okay, I guess I'm still high
Okay, a high on you
One kiss, one touch, all in
One more time
Stay the night
Maybe two

Why don't we just go back
Back to where we came from?
The summer air
The summer air
Why don't we just go back
Back to where we came from?
The summer air
The summer air

Let's go back
Let's go now
Let's go back
Let's go now
Let's go back
Let's go now
Let's go back
Let's go now
The summer air
The summer air

You grabbed my hand
You took me to paradise
And by no chance if I get this night
Since I'm back home
I feel like paralyzed
Baby it's all wrong
Let's make it right

Why don't we just go back
Back to where we came from?
The summer air
The summer air
Why don't we just go back
Back to where we came from?
The summer air
The summer air

Let's go back
Let's go now
Let's go back
Let's go now
Let's go back
Let's go now
The summer air

Why don't we just go back?
