                        Blacked out,
 Everything faded on your love,
 I'm already wasted so close
 That I can taste it now... Now...

 So let's break right out of these guilty cages
 We're going to make it now...
 Don't ever turn around
 Don't ever turn around

 Nobody else needs to know
 Where we might go...
 We could just run them red lights
 We could just run them red lights

 There ain't no reason to stay
 We'll be light years away...
 We could just run them red lights
 We could just run them red lights

 We could just run them red lights
 We could just run them red lights

 White lights, flirt in the darkness
 This road leads where your heart is
 These signs, something we can't ignore

 We can't back down
 We'll never let them change us
 We're going to make it now
 What are we waiting for...
 What are we waiting for...

 Nobody else needs to know
 Where we might go...
 We could just run them red lights
 We could just run them red lights

 There ain't no reason to stay
 We'll be light years away...

 We could just run them red lights
 We could just run them red lights

 We could just run them red lights
 We could just run them red lights
                        
                    |
