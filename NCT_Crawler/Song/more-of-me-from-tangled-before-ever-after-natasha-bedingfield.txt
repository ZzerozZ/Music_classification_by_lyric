                        Bài hát: More Of Me (From "Tangled: Before Ever After") - Natasha Bedingfield

I was always searching for a reason
Never knew that taste of freedom
I knew that there was some more than just what I was seeing
But it was so hard to believe it

Then somehow you brought out
A strength that was deep down
Let it out
Now I got my eyes open and wide

My heart burnin' like fire
Feels like I'm so alive
I'm never going back
Whatever I want now, I'm gonna chase

Who I am I can't contain it
I'm not gonna hold it in
'Cause there's more of me to give
There's more of me to give

I can feel the sunlight shining through me
There's a beautiful world under my feet
It's all mine, its time to soak it all up
Full speed, can't keep it bottled up

Feel my spirit, let it run wild
Then somehow you brought out
A strength that was deep down
Let it out

Now I got my eyes openin' wider
My heart burnin' like fire
Feels like I'm so alive
I'm never going back

Whatever I want now, I'm gonna chase
Who I am I can't contain it
I'm not gonna hold it in
'Cause there's more of me to give

There's more of me to give
Oh yeah
There's no limit we can be
Everything we're meant to be

Im seein' it all through different eyes
For the first time
Larger than life
I got my eyes openin' wider

My heart burnin, like fire, yeah
Now I got my eyes openin' wider
My heart burnin' like fire
Feels like I'm so alive

I'm never going back
Whatever I want now, I'm gonna chase
Who I am I can't contain it
I'm not gonna hold it in

'Cause there's more of me to give (oh yeah)
There's more of me to give
There's more of me to give
                        
                    |
