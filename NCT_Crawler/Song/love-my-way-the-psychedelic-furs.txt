Thể Loại Khác|

                        There's an army on the dance floor
 It's a fashion with a gun my love
 In a room without a door
 A kiss is not enough in
 Love my way, it's a new road
 I follow where my mind goes
 They'd put us on a railroad
 They'd dearly make us pay
 For laughing in their faces
 And making it our way
 There's emptiness behind their eyes
 There's dust in all their hearts
 They just want to steal us all
 And take us all apart
 But not in
 Love my way, it's a new road
 I follow where my mind goes
 Love my way, it's a new road
 I follow where my mind goes
 Love my way, it's a new road
 I follow where my mind goes
 So swallow all your tears my love
 And put on your new face
 You can never win or lose
 If you don't run the race
                        
                    |
