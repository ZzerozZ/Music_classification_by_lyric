                        You wake up
Watch the world go 'round
You shiver
Feeling upside down
Your heart is beating fast
Pumping blood to your head
Another day to fight
You have a prayer on your lips under the desert sun
And a loaded gun

You remember every word
That your father said
Stay out of trouble son
And be true to yourself
You'll be working like a dog
Raise a family
And life will be alright
But now it's written in the stars if you'll make it out alive
Out alive

The good die young
There might be no tomorrow
In god we trust
Through all this pain and sorrow
The good die young
The flame will burn forever
And no one knows your name
Bring the boys back home again
Home Again...

It was a quiet day
On the streets of hope
When the bomb went off
At the side of the road
Sounds of breaking steel
An windshield full of blood
No enemy in sight
It feels like in a movie scenes are passing by
It's your life

The good die young
There might be no tomorrow
In god we trust
Through all this pain and sorrow
The good die young
The flame will burn forever
And no one knows your name
Bring the boys back home again
Home Again...

You remember every word
That your father said
Stay out of trouble son
And be true to yourself
got a prayer on your lips under the desert sun
And a loaded gun

The good die young
There might be no tomorrow
In god we trust
Through all this pain and sorrow

Yeah Yeah...

The good die young
The flame will burn forever
And no one knows your name
Bring the boys back home again
Home Again...
