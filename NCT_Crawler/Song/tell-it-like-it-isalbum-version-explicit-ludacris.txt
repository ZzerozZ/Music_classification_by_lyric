R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        [Verse:]
 Things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be
 Like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry
 Talkin' bout what they got, and they ain't got a damn thang
 How you own three cars, but you don't own ya own name?
 Get ya business right boys, the first class is in session
 Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession
 Start up ya own company, trademark the name
 That's gon' run ya bout a grand so start savin' ya change
 Open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps
 Sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks
 Hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need
 Whatever gets ya juices flowin' could be speed or weed
 Get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered
 Sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk, ya ***!
 Show all the non-believers what you destined to be
 And in just a couple years you could be rich like me

 [Hook:]
 But I can't hold my tounge
 I'ma tell it like it is
 This biz ain't all fun
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Give it to ya straight, no chase
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Look you straight in yo face
 And I'ma tell it like it is

 I can't hold my tounge
 I'ma tell it like it is
 This biz ain't all fun
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Give it to ya straight, no chase
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Look you straight in yo face
 And I'ma tell it like it is

 [Verse 2:]
 See, mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems
 The money could be the problem, but money can't solve 'em
 Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy
 Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy
 I'm close 'cause those close wanna live off my fame
 And that type of *** alone will drive a nigga insane
 Not to mention all the vultures, the scandelous promoters
 Crabs will try to sue ya, magazines will misquote ya
 Most of these label-heads, they don't care nothin' about ya
 If you stop sellin' records, they'll act like they don't know ya
 It's hard mixin' business with pleasure, so don't play
 Me and my crew argue and fight like every other day
 Rappers ain't above the law, but our life is so fast
 That we got a Special Task Force of police on our ass
 All that, and this is really just the start of it
 Hip Hop, you really wanna be a part of it?

 [Hook:]
 I can't hold my tounge
 I'ma tell it like it is
 This biz ain't all fun
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Give it to ya straight, no chase
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Look you straight in yo face
 And I'ma tell it like it is

 I can't hold my tounge
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Man this biz ain't all fun
 I'ma tell it like it is
 I'ma give it to ya straight, no chase
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Look you straight in yo face
 And I'ma tell it like it is

 [Verse 3:]
 What's worse than havin' no money is havin' it and losin' it
 What's worse than havin' some money is grabbin' and abusin' it
 We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool wit him
 I wish his ass well, but I don't want nothin' to do with him!
 Some don't own they publishin', me I never fool wit 'em
 I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em
 'Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant
 Unless I'm still in competition with my president
 And believe that I'm supportin' the Hova
 ''Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over'
 But the first rule to accumalation of wealth
 Is Don't trust nobody but ya God damned self!

 [Hook:]
 I can't hold my tounge
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Man this biz ain't all fun
 I'ma tell it like it is
 I'm give it to ya straight, no chase
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Look you straight in yo face
 And I'ma tell it like it is

 I said I can't hold my tounge
 I'ma tell it like it is
 This biz ain't all fun
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Give it to ya straight, no chase
 I'ma tell it like it is
 Look you straight in yo face
 And I'ma tell it like it is
