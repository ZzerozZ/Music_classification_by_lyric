You're like ice
I-C-E,
Feels so nice
Scorching me,
You're so hot hot
Baby, your love is so hot, hot

Pull up,
She been purring like a kitten
Cravin' your love
I've been counting down the days you been gone
A little too long, patient
Knowing exactly what it is
It lasts time and now

When you come and lay between it this time
Take the ice cube (boy, you know what)
Sit it right below my navel
And watch what I do
And that's my favorite angle
My legs are numb now
Your loving be giving me chills

You're like ice
I-C-E,
Feels so nice
Scorching me,
You're so hot hot
Baby, your love is so hot, hot

You put the pillow (right there)
Underneath my back
Got me up against the window (right now)
We got no shame, we going in
He hates it when I use my hands
He got me saying, 'Damn my man knows what he's doing'

The mirrors, the mirrors
Up on the ceiling got things so visual, so visual
Babe, I ain't never felt so right, yeah
He comes again, my body going numb
Hot as ice, can't get enough

You're like ice
I-C-E,
Feels so nice
Scorching me,
You're so hot hot (me and Ms Kelly)
Baby, your love is so hot, hot (another track)

[Lil' Wayne:]
Uh, ice, ice baby
Shake that ass just like dice baby
You hot and I'm tunechi
I beat that cat, animal cruelty
I'm colder than your man
He should be your ex
I throw that ass back like we playing pitch and catch
F*cking right
And all your hear is what's my name, it's your p*ssy
Sweet tooth roll tussy
If you are what you eat I'm so p*ssy
I'm skating on thin ice
I put it in her wind pipe, we do it 'til we both exhausted
Twin pipes, pillow under her stomach
The other pillow she bites
Would you like anything?
'Cause I'll do anything you like
I make her freeze up
Pick her knees up,
She want a maid nigga
Watch me clean up,
I know where to put it
I put it in her life
I leave that p*ssy smoking
Smoking like ice

You're like ice (tunechi)
I-C-E,
Feels so nice
Scorching me (young mulla, babe),
You're so hot, hot (I got that come back)
Baby, your love is so hot, hot

You're like ice
I-C-E,
Feels so nice
Scorching me,
You're so hot, hot
Baby, your love is so hot, hot
You're like ice
