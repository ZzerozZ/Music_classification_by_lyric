Âu Mỹ khác|

                        With out backs to the wall, the darkness would fall
Never quite thought we could loose it all
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
An empire's falling just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away (fire!)
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away

Off in the distance, staring's resistant
Bottling up and festering
Hey Mr Motion, make me a potion
Shake it all up with your mystery
How come I've never seen your face 'round here?
I know every single face 'round here
A man on a mission, changing the vision
I was never welcome here

We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way

With our backs to the wall, the darkness would fall
We never quite thought we could loose it all
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
An empire's falling just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away (fire!)
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away

Back in the casing, shaking and pacing
This is the tunnel's light
Blood in the writing, stuck in the fighting
Look through the riffle's sight
How come I've never seen your face 'round here?
I know every single face 'round here
Here in the heckle, holding the shackle
I was never welcome here

We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way

With our backs to the wall, the darkness would fall
We never quite thought we could loose it all
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
An empire's falling just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away (fire!)
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away

Woah

With our backs to the wall, the darkness would fall
We never quite thought we could loose it all
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
An empire's falling just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away (fire!)
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away
                        
                    |
