R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        I was chilling,
 Right around my way,
 21st Eastside of the Beach,
 This *** ran up on me,
 Talkin' *** with his homies,
 Like he was a straight G,
 Askin' where I'm from
 While he runnin' up,
 Gang bang my set on every one of 'em,
 Something son they just won't change,
 Fools don't respect nothin' but the gang bang,
 What's seen is what's on,
 Dog is the law
 I had you niggas runnin' like a marathon,
 Lil' G's tryin to creep on the ease wit' it,
 Talkin' 'bout they gon get my chain
 And they gon leave wit' it,
 But they don't know,
 Once they get close
 It's tic tac toe,
 Three ***s laid on the flo'
 (watch out, watch out)
 Yea, this happened yesterday
 On the west they spray,
 I heard a ese say, he said Vato, you won't believe what I saw,
 I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard
 (And what they do?)
 They twist they fingers, say you know who we are,
 He say I don't give a ***, I Snoop Doggy Dogg
 They keep talkin' then it went too far,
 So Snoopy he went straight to the trunk of his car,
 ( And what he get?)
 He got his gun and they start runnin' hard,
 He started firing and then he just charged,
 Run nigga run nigga
 Duck nigga duck nigga
 Run mother***er run
 Run mother***er run
 Run nigga run nigga
 Duck nigga duck nigga
 Run *** run I didn't mean to hit what I hit,
 Now that's three ***s dead
 And I ain't seen ***,
 But these niggas will scream a plea,
 But for a G like me
 It's just a case, really you could see,
 I crack the mack back and pop off rollin',
 And smack ya neck back you drop off fallin',
 I haven't seen my momma in a week,
 And she ain't even ran her mouth about me,
 *** that, I don't give a *** about the law,
 Niggas say they wanna brawl,
 You would think that they were brods,
 Believin' all the things that you never saw,
 In it ya'll, been a Dogg, smoke you like a menethol,
 You think you know, but this can't go,
 You think you'll blow, on my door,
 What the ***, No,
 See these niggas proceed with speed,
 So feel the need to bleed,
 All you hear my enemies goin' I wouldn't be the nigga that I am,
 If I didn't pop niggas in they mouth,
 God Damn,
 And Snoop will keep one foot on the streets,
 And leave 'em covered in sheets,
 Run wit' dem niggas wit da heat,
 Ya never seen a thug like this,
 Ya never seen a dub like me,
 And I ain't weak fo war and peace,
 In fact I could be Beast of the East,
 Mother ***a,
 I never hesitate to blaze,
 A nigga really tryin' to change his ways,
 We gotta move our team,
 Cuz my people is screamin' that we need mo'
 For funnel is illegal,
 Ba-ba-bang on this song,
 Make it feel like a drive by,
 It's a shame but somebody gotta die,
 They say it happens state to state,
 But when I mob in LA,
 All I hear the ese's say,
 (They go) Snoop Dogg him bust gun shots,
 Skate board P they say him bust gun shots
 DPG them bust gunshots
 BBC ya know them bust gun shots
 Come again now,
 Snoop Dogg him bust gun shots
 Skate board P you know him bust gust gun shots,
 Come again now,
 BBC them bust gun shots,
 DPG see you know dem bust gun shots
 Run mother***er
 Run mother***er
