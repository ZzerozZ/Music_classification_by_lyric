                        Bài hát: All I Ever Wanted (Remix) - Basshunter

All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see?

All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted
Was to make you mine
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted
Was you and me

All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted
Was to make you mine
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted
Was you and me

I'm so alone
Here on my own
And I'm waiting for you to come
I want to be a part of you
Think of all the things we could do

And every day
You're in my head
I want to have you in my bed
You are the one
You're in my eyes
All I ever wanted in my life

All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted
Was to make you mine
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted
Was you and me
                        
                    |
