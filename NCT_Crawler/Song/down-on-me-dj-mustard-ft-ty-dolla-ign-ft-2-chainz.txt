 Only live once is my motto
 After we have sex I pay your car note
 Wearing Ferragamos and Benihanos
 I'm pulling up the way I turtleneck in the summer
 With a girl named Summer put her leg to the ceiling fan
 So wet I might dive off the diving-board
 I watch you pop it like a rubberband
 New Rollie, I don't mind spending time alone
 I want you so bad that I pray for it
 Might stay till the club close 'cause I wait for it Got a bitch that drop it down for a nigga
