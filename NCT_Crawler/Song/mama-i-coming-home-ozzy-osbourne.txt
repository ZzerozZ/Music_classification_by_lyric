                        Times have changed and times are strange
Here I come but I ain't the same
Mama I'm comin' home

Times go bye, seems to be
You could have been a better friend to me
Mama I'm comin' home

You took me in and you drove me out
Yeah you had me hypnotized yeah
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

You made me cry, you told me lies
But I can't stand to say goodbye
Mama I'm comin' home

I could be right, I could be wrong
It hurts so bad it's been so long
Mama, I'm comin' home

Selfish love yeah we're both alone
The ride before the fall yeah
But I'm gonna take this heart of stone
I just got to have it all

I've seen your face a hundred times
Everyday we've been apart
I don't care about the sunshine yeah
'Cause mama, mama I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home

You took me in and you drove me out
Yeah you had me hypnotized yeah
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

I've seen your face a thousand times
Everyday we've been apart
And I don't care about the sunshine yeah
'Cause mama, mama I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
