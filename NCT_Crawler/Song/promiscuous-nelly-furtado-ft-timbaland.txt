                        Bài hát: Promiscuous - Nelly Furtado, Timbaland

Am I throwing you off?
Nope
Didn't think so

How you doin' young lady
That feelin' that you givin' really drivin' me crazy
You don't have ta play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

If you looking for a girl that'll treat you right
If you lookin' for her in the day time with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem I don't see no ring on your hand

I be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?

Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, are you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through

I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game I'm a lay mine's down

I'm a big girl I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team, so does everybody else

Baby, we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?

Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, are you ready?

Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Hey, Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my T-shirt on
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

Bring that on, you know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy the way you're making me wait

Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, we're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more
