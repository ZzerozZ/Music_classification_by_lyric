                        Bài hát: Flash - Cigarettes After Sex

I'm a flash, you were blinded by the love I had
I'm a flash, the light could only get in through the cracks

And you've got to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph

When they crash, the helicopters in my heart are red
Cut in half, you saw me lying there bleeding to death

And you had to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph

Now I stand on the stage, I forget my lines
Do you play Satan's imagination
And a voice in my head's causing suicide
Searching for any way to remember them

And you've got to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
                        
                    |
