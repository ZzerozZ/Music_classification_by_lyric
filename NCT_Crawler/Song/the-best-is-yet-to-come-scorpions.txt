Rock|

                        Across the desert plains
Where nothing dares to grow
I taught you how to sing
You taught me everything I know
And though the night is young
And we don't know if we'll live to see the sun

The best is yet to come
I know, you know
That we've only just begun
Through the highs and lows
And how can I live without you
You're such a part of me
And you've always been the one
Keeping me forever young
And the best is yet to come

Heya aeh ho
Don't look now, the best is yet to come
Heya aeh ho
Take my hand, the best is yet to come

Thinking of the times
How we laughed and cried
I wouldn't change a thing
I couldn't even if I tried
Through the wind and rain
The spirit of our song remains the same

And the best is yet to come
I know, you know
That we've only just begun
Through the highs and lows
And how can I live without you
You're such a part of me
And you've always been the one
Keeping me forever young
And the best is yet to come

Heya aeh ho
Don't look now, the best is yet to come
Heya aeh ho
Take my hand, the best is yet to come

Oh can you feel it in the air
It's in your heart and everywhere
We got to keep that dream alive

We cross another road
And face another day
Soldiers never die
They only fade away
How can we grow old
When the soundtrack of our lives is rock and roll

And the best is yet to come
I know, you know
That we've only just begun
Through the highs and lows
And how can I live without you
You're such a part of me
And you've always been the one
Keeping me forever young
And the best is yet to come

Heya aeh ho
Don't look now, the best is yet to come
Heya aeh ho
Take my hand, the best is yet to come

Heya aeh ho
Don't look now, the best is yet to come
Heya aeh ho
Take my hand, the best is yet to come
                        
                    |
