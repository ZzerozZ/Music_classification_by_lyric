                        Bài hát: You Belong With Me - Taylor

You're on the phone with your girlfriend 
she"s upset. 
She"s going off about something that you said 
'Cuz she doesn't get your humor like I do... 
I'm in the room 
It's a typical Tuesday night 
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like 
and she'll never know your story like i do 

But she wears short skirts 
I wear T-shirts 
She's cheer captain 
And I'm on the bleachers 
Dreaming about the day when you wake up 
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time 


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
been here all along so why can't you see, you 
You belong with me 
You belong with me 

Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans 
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be 
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself 
Hey isn't this easy 

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town 
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine 
I know you better then that 
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that 

She wears high heels 
I wear sneakers 
She"s cheer captain and 
I'm on the bleachers 
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find 
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time 

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see 
You belong with me 
Standing by and waiting at your back door 
all this time how could you not know 
Baby.... 
You belong with me 
You belong with me 

Oh 
I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night 
I'm the one who makes you laugh 
When you know you're about to cry 
And I know your favorite songs 
And you tell me about your dreams 
Think I know where you belong 
Think I know it's with me... 

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you 
Been here all along 
So why can't you see 
You belong with me 
Standing by and waiting at your back door 
All this time 
How could you not know 
Baby you belong with me 
You belong with me 

You belong with me 

Have you ever thought just maybe 

you belong with me 

You belong with me...
