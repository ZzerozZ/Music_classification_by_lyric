                        Hello, hello baby you called? 
I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you see, see
Wha-Wha-What did you say, 
Oh, you're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy.

K-kinda busy
K-kinda busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy.

Just a second, 
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with
A drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, 
You knew that I was free.
And now you won't stop calling me; 
I'm kinda busy.

Stop callin', stop callin', 
I don't wanna think anymore! 
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor.
Stop callin', stop callin', 
I don't wanna talk anymore! 
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor.

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me! 
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy! 
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me! 
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

You can call all you want, 
But there's no one home, 
And you're not gonna reach my telephone! 
Cuz I'm out in the club, 
And I'm sippin' that bubb, 
And you're not gonna reach my telephone! 

Call when you want, 
But there's no one home, 
And you're not gonna reach my telephone! 
Cuz I'm out in the club, 
And I'm sippin' that bubb, 
And you're not gonna reach my telephone! 

Beyonce:

Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster.
Put my coat no faster, 
Leave my girls no faster.
I shoulda left my phone at home, 
'Cause this is a disaster! 
Callin' like a collector -
Sorry, I cannot answer! 

Not that I don't like you, 
I'm just at a party.
And I am sick and tired
Of my phone r-ringing.

Beyonce:

Sometimes I feel like
I live in Grand Central Station.
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 
'Cause I'll be dancin'.

'Cause I'll be dancin'
'Cause I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'! 

Stop callin', stop callin', 
I don't wanna think anymore! 
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor.
Stop callin', stop callin', 
I don't wanna talk anymore! 
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor.

Stop callin', stop callin', 
I don't wanna think anymore! 
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor.
Stop callin', stop callin', 
I don't wanna talk anymore! 
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor.

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me! 
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy! 
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me! 
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Can call all you want,
