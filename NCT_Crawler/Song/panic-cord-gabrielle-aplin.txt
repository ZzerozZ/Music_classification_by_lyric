                        Bài hát: Panic Cord - Gabrielle Aplin


You kept all the things I threw away
A leaf I picked, a birthday card I made
Holding on to memories of you and me
We didn't last a year, oh
We're just a box of souvenirs
'Cause

Maybe I pulled the panic cord
And maybe you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame

This meant more to you than it did to me
I was full of doubt and you believed
The more that you keep coming over
The more I know it's over, dear
We're just a box of souvenirs
And

Maybe I pulled the panic cord
Maybe you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame

Maybe you were just too nice to me
Maybe it took me way too long to leave
Maybe once we felt the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame

Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do
That's the way the story goes, oh
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do
That's the way the story goes, oh

Maybe I pulled the panic cord
And maybe you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe you were just too nice to me
Maybe it took me way too long to leave
Maybe once we felt the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame
