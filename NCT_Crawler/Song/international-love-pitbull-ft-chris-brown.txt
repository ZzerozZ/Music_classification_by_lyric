                        Bài hát: International Love - Pitbull, Chris Brown 

Went from Mr. 305 to Mr. Worldwide
Now we're international, so international, international
So international

You can't catch me boy
I am overseas at about a hundred Gs for sure
Don't test me boy 'cause I rap with the best
Fo'sho three oh five to the death of me
Cremate my body let the ocean have what's left of me
But for now forget about that
Blow the whistle, baby you're the referee

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh oh oh oh it's international love
Oh oh oh oh it's international love

I don't play football
But I've touched down everywhere, everywhere
I don't play baseball
But I've hit a home run everywhere 
everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed
In Romania she pulled me to the side
And told me Pit you can have me and my sister
In Lebanon yeah the women the bomb
And in Greece you guessed it the women are sweet
Been all around the world
But I ain't gonna lie there's nothing like Miami's heat

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh oh oh oh it's international love
Oh oh oh oh it's international love

Down in DR they're looking for visa's
I ain't taking credit cards if you know what I mean
En cuba la cosa esta dura
But the woman get down, if you know what I mean
En Colombia the women got everything done, but they're
Some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil they're freaky with big ol' booties
And they bounce in blue yellow and green
En L.A. tengo la Mexicana, en New York tengo la boricua
Besitos para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah
Y en Miami tengo cualquiera

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh oh oh oh it's international love
Oh oh oh oh it's international love

There's not a place that your love don't affect me baby
So don't ever change
I crossed the globe when I'm with you baby
Hey

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh oh oh oh it's international love
Oh oh oh oh it's international love

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh oh oh oh it's international love
Oh oh oh oh it's international love

You're international, so international
You're international, so international
You're international, so international
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
International love
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
International love
