                        Bài hát: About You Now - Sugababes

It was so easy that night
Should have been strong, yeah, I lied
Nobody gets me like you

Couldn't keep hold of you then
How could I know what you meant
There was nothing to compare to

I know everything changes
All the cities and faces
But I know how I feel about you

There's a mountain between us
But there's one thing I'm sure of
That I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now?
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

All that it takes one more chance
Don't let our last kiss be our last
Give me tonight and I'll show you

I know everything changes
I don't care where it takes us
'Cause I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now?
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Not a day passed me by
Not a day passed me by
When I don't think about you

And there's no moving on
'Cause I know you? re the one
And I can't be without you

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now?
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now?
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

But I know how I feel about you now
Yeah, I know how I feel about you now
