                        Bài hát: Livin My Love - Steve Aoki, LMFAO, Nervo

Ahh..

When I wake up
Still drunk got my shoes on my feet
I’m hesitating to look at my computer screen
I live up
On a cloud for the whole world to see

We got that party pooper, head to toe
It’s going full of sass, straight down the throat
Ganging money, coupon with note
Two bad boys, them girls a fraud

LMFAO, yo yo, LMFAO, yo yo
We stopped killing our buzz
We party rock with you

I’m just living my
I’m just living my
I’m just living my love, love, love
Why you killing my
Why you killing my
Why you killing my buzz, buzz, buzz

I’m not gonna play fair
If you don’t play back
I don’t wanna be a bitch
But this game is wack
So get of my way
Say whatever you say
I’ll be living my love
Living, living

So you can be a hater
If it turns you on
Do whatever you want
If it makes you feel strong
But you better down
‘Cause this road is long
And I’ll be living my love
Living, living
I’ll be living my love

I’m just living my
I’m just living my
I’m just living my love, love, love
(I’ll be living my love)

Why you killing my
Why you killing my
Why you killing my buzz, buzz, buzz

Yo, I don’t mean to stop you
But you might wanna pick up the name you just drop
I’m like a helicopter, yeah you up in the building
But I’m up on top ya
Hey man, take this binaca
While I walk around the club
Wanna fizz the vodka
A party rocker
A panty dropper

Shut up, who’s laughing at your jokes
Now, shut, down
You should walk away
Cause no one’s laughing at your jokes
Now, yes it shut, down
You better hear me say

I, I, I
You better hear me say
I, I, I
Go go go go go go

I’ve been living my love!

I’m just living my
I’m just living my
I’m just living my love, love, love
(I’ll be living my love)
Why you killing my
Why you killing my
Why you killing my buzz, buzz, buzz

I’m just living my
I’m just living my
I’m just living my love, love, love
(I’ll be living my love)
Why you killing my
Why you killing my
Why you killing my buzz, buzz, buzz.
