                        Bài hát: Purple Haze - Jimi Hendrix

Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things just don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Help me
Help me
I don't know

Yeah! Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

Oh!
Help me!
Ah, yeah! Purple haze
I don't know
Tell me
Tell me
(Purple haaaaaze)
(Purple haaaaaze)
Blowin' my mind
