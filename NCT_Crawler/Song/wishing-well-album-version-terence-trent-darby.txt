                        Kissing like a bandit stealing time
 Underneath the sycamore tree
 Cupid by the hour sends valentines
 To my sweet lover and me
 Slowely
 Surely
 Yours appetite is more than I know
 Sweetly
 Softly
 I'm falling in love with you

 Chorus:
 Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
 A wishing well of butterfly tear
 Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
 A wishing well of crocodile cheers

 Hugging like a monkey see monkey do
 Right beside a riverboat gambler
 Erotic images float through my head
 I wanna be your midnight rambler
 Quickly
 Quickly
 The blood races through my veins
 Quickly
 Loudly
 I wanna hear those sugar bells ring

 Chorus
