                        I took a walk in the rain one day
 On the wrong side of the tracks
 I stood on the rails till I saw that train
 Just to see how my heart would react Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate
 And for them I cannot disagree
 But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
 I say fate should not tempt me I take my chances, I don't mind working without a net
 I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get I sat alone in the dark one night
 Tuning in by remote
 I found a preacher who spoke of the light
 But there was brimstone in his throat He'd show me the way according to him
 In return for my personal check
 I flipped my channel back to CNN
 And I lit another cigarettes I take my chances, yes, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
 I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get I've crossed lines of words and wire
 And both have cut me deep
 I've been frozen out and I've been on fire
 And the tears are mine to weep But I can cry until I laugh
 Or laugh until I cry
 So cut the deck right in half
 I'll play from either side I take my chances, I pay my dollar and I place my bet
 I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get I take my chances, yeah I don't cling to remorse or regret
 I take my chances, I take my chances, every chance I get
 I take my chances, I take my chances
