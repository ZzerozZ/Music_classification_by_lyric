                        Bài hát : Come Back And Stay - Bad Boys Blue

Walk in the rain
Tryin' to wash away the pain
You went away
I made you cry so many days

Where do broken hearts go to?
How can broken hearts find their way back home
When nobody cares about you and you're feeling blue?

Come back and stay
Don't keep me waiting, baby
Come back and stay
Don't say goodbye
Don't let my love die

Come back and stay
And try again
Don't walk away
For I'm still your man
Where are you now?
Where did you go?

Come back and stay
Don't keep me waiting
I'll miss you so

Walk in the rain
Thinking about the game I play
I am to blame
I lost my lovin' yesterday

Where do broken hearts go to?
How can broken hearts find their way back home
When nobody cares about you and you're feeling blue?

Come back and stay
Don't keep me waiting, baby
Come back and stay
Don't say goodbye
Don't let my love die

Come back and stay
And try again
Don't walk away
For I'm still your man
Where are you now?
Where did you go?

Since I've been gone I've missed you
I missed your touch, oh, baby

Come back and stay
Don't keep me waiting, baby
Come back and stay
Don't say goodbye
Don't let my love die

Come back and stay
And try again
Don't walk away
For I'm still your man
Where are you now?
Where did you go?
Where are you now?
