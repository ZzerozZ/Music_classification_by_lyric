                        Bài hát: When I Look At You - Miley Cyrus

Everybody needs inspiration 
Everybody needs a song 
Beautiful melody, when the nights so long 

Cause there is no guarantee 
That this life is easy (Yeah) 
When my world is falling apart, 
when there is no light to break up the dark 
That's when I (I) look at you 
When the waves are flooding the shore and I 
can't find my way home anymore 
That's when I (I) look at you 

When I look at you 
I see forgiveness, I see the truth 
You love me for who I am like the stars 
hold the moon 
Right there where they belong and I know 
I'm not alone (Yeah) 

When my world is falling apart, 
when there is no light to break up the dark 
That's when I (I) look at you 
When the waves are flooding the shore and I 
can't find my way home anymore 
That's when I (I) look at you 

When the waves are flooding the shore and I 
can't find my way home anymore 
That's when I (I) look at you 

You appear just like a dream to me 
Just like a kaleidoscope colors that cover me 
All I need every breath that I breathe 
Don't you know you're beautiful (Yeah, Yeah) 

When the waves are flooding the shore and I 
can't find my way home anymore 
That's when I (I) look at you 

You appear just like a dream to me.
