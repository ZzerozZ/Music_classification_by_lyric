                        A Daydream Away I wish you could see your face right now
 'Cause you're grinning like a fool
 And we're sitting on your kitchen floor
 On a Tuesday afternoon
 Doesn't matter when we get back
 To doing what we do
 'Cause right now could last forever
 Just as long as I'm with you You're just a daydream away
 I wouldn't know what to say if I had you
 And I'll keep you a daydream away
 Just watch from a safe place so I never have to lose We would go out on the weekend
 To escape our busy lives
 And we'd laugh at all the douche-bag guys
 Chasing down their desperate wives
 I would drink a little too much
 And you'd offer me a ride
 I would offer you a t-shirt
 And you would stay another night You're just a daydream away
 I wouldn't know what to say if I had you
 And I'll keep you a daydream away
 Just watch from a safe place so I never have to lose We never stood a chance out there
 Shooting love in real-time
 So we'll take it over ice tonight
 With a little salt
 And a little lime You're just a daydream away
 I wouldn't know what to say if I had you
 And I'll keep you a daydream away
 Just watch from a safe place so I never have to lose You're just a daydream away
 I wouldn't know what to say if I had you
                        
                    |
