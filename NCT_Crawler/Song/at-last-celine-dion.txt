Âu Mỹ khác|

                        At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I have looked at you

I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that i, can call my own
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to
A thrill that i, have never known

You smiled, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to
A thrill that i, have never known

You smiled you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
At last
At last
                        
                    |
