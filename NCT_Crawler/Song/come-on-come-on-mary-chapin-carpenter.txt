                        Some people remember the first time
 Some can't forget the last
 Some just select what they want to from the past
 It's a song that you danced to in high school
 It's a moon you tried to bring down
 On a four-in-the-morning drive through the streets of town Come on come on, it's getting late now
 Come on come on, take my hand
 Come on come on, you just have to whisper
 Come on come on, I will understand It's a photograph taken in Paris, at the end of the honeymoon
 In 1948, late in the month of June
 Your parents smile for the camera in sienna shades of light
 Now you're older than they were then that summer night Come on come on, it's getting late now
 Come on come on, take my hand
 Come on come on, you just have to whisper
 Come on come on, I will understand It's a need you never get used to, so fierce and so confused
 It's a loss you never get over the first time you lose And tonight I am thinking of someone, seventeen years ago
 We rode in his daddy's car down the river road Come on come on, it's getting late now
 Come on come on, take my hand
 Come on come on, you just have to whisper
 Come on come on, I will understand
 Come on come on, it's getting late now
 Come on come on, take my hand
 Come on come on, you just have to whisper
 Come on come on
