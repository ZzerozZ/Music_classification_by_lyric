Christina Aguilera - Stripped Intro

I've waited a long time for this
It feels right now

Allow me to introduce myself
I want you to come a little closer
I'd like you to get to know me a little bit better
Meet the real me

Sorry you can't define me
Sorry I break the mold
Sorry that I speak my mind
Sorry don't do what I'm told
Sorry if I don't fake it
Sorry I come too real
I will never hide what I really feel

Huh, so here it is
No hype, no gloss, no pretense
Just me
Stripped
