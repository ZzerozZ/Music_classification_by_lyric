Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Baby I know the story
I've seen the picture
It's written all over your face
Tell me, what's the secret 
That you've been hiding 
And who's gonna take my place

I should've seen it comin' 
I should've read the signs 
Anyway, I guess it's over 

Can't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know 
You never told me 
Can't believe that I'm the fool again
And I who thought you were my friend 
How was I to know, you never told me 

Baby, you should've called me
When you were lonely
When you needed me to be there

Sadly, you never gave me 
To many chances
To show you how much I care 

I should've seen it comin' 
I should've read the signs 
Anyway, I guess it's over 

Can't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know 
You never told me 
Can't believe that I'm the fool again
And i who thought you were my friend 
How was I to know, you never told me 

About the pain and the tears
ohooooo, if i could I would
Turn back the time 

oh yeah...

I Should've seen it comin'
I should've read the signs 
Anyway, I guess it's over 

Can't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know 
You never told me 
Can't believe that I'm the fool again
And i who thought you were my friend 
How was I to know, you never told me 

Can't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know 
You never told me 
Can't believe that I'm the fool again
And i who thought you were my friend 
How was I to know, you never told me
