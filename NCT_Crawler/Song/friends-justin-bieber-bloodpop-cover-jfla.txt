                        Bài hát: Friends (Justin Bieber & Bloodpop Cover) - J.Fla

I was wonderin' 'bout your mama 
Did she get that job she wanted? 
Sold that car that gave her problems? 
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest 

Girl, you wonderin' why I've been callin'? 
Like I've got ulterior motives 
No, we didn't end this so good 
But you know we had something so good 

So I'm wondering, can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 
Can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends? 
Can we be friends? 
Can we be friends? 

Wonderin' if you got a body 
To hold you tight since I left 
Wonderin' if you think about me 
Actually, don't answer that 

Now you wonderin' why I've been callin'? 
Like I've got ulterior motives 
No, we didn't end this so good 
But you know we had something so good 

So I'm wondering, can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 
Can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends? 
Can we be friends? 
Can we be friends? 
And if it ends, can we be friends? 

Now you wonderin' why I've been callin'? 
Like I've got ulterior motives 
No, we didn't end this so good 
But you know we had something so good 

I'm wondering, can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 
Can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends?
                        
                    |
