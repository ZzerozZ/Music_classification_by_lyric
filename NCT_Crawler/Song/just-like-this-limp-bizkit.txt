                        Get up, get up
 I like this
 Just like this
 Do you feel it?
 Then get up
 Get up
 Just like this Do you wanna catch the vibe?
 That's keepin' me alive
 I'm followin' these fat ass beats until I die
 Fill 'em with tension, the sick dimension
 I rumble the earth with the lowered suspension
 Just watch the ground move, let the sound prove
 That it ain't fake when the girls get naked Don't call it a comeback, we bring that beat back
 And we make sure that John kept them beats phat
 A lyrical rampage, burnin' your headset
 Open your mind, my rhymes ain't dead yet
 I want you to stand up, and put them hands up
 And break it down 'cause you're pumpin' my band up I like this
 Just like this
 C'mon get up
 Get up, get up
 Music is key
 It's the way we're set free
 From all this world is throwin' at me The rhythm's so insane, it's flowin' through your vein
 Triggerin' that neck poppin' nerve up in your brain
 I don't even know ya, but came to show ya
 The Bizkit's limp when the night is over
 We shake the whole place, make this earthquake
 And it ain't fake when we start the riots Rock the bells, psycho females
 Doin' time, blowin' up the phoneline
 Call it a stampede, comin' to your town
 We ain't gonna hold back, we're comin' to get down
 I want ya to stand up, and put them hands up
 And break it on down 'cause you're pumpin' my band up I like this
 Baby, just like this
 Get high up
 C'mon, get up
 Music is key
 It's the way we're set free
 From all this world is throwin' at me
 And I'll do what it takes
 If I make some mistakes
 It's okay 'cause it's all just the way it should be
 I break it Limp Bizkit's in the house you all
 Limp Bizkit's in the house you all
 Limp Bizkit's in the house you all
 Yo John, bring that beat back Uhh, just like this
 Do you feel it?
 Just like this
 Yo bring that beat back
 Music is key
 It's the way we're set free
 From all this world is throwin' at me
 And I do what it takes
 If I make some mistakes
 It's okay 'cause it's all just the way it should be
