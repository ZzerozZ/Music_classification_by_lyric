                        Crowded streets all cleared away
 One by one
 Hollow heroes separate
 As they run You're so cold
 Keep your hand in mine
 Wise men wonder while
 Strong men die Show me how it ends
 It's alright
 Show me how defenseless
 You really are
 Satisfied and empty inside
 That's alright
 Let's give this another try If you find your family
 Don't you cry
 In this land of make believe
 Dead and dry You're so cold
 But you feel alive
 Lay your hands on me
 One last time Show me how it ends
 It's alright
 Show me how defenseless
 You really are
 Satisfied and empty inside
 That's alright
 Let's give this another try Show me how it ends
 It's alright
 Show me how defenseless
 You really are
 Satisfied and empty inside
 That's alright
 Let's give this another try It's alright
 It's alright
 It's alright
 It's alright
 It's alright
 It's alright
 It's alright
 It's alright
 It's alright
