                        Bài hát: Almost Home - Mariah Carey

Guess now its official
Cant back out, cant back out (no)
Getting ready for the night of nights
The night of nights, alright
Dont Panic (Panic!)

Now do we have to dress up for the prom?
Dude I dont think we have the choice
Yeah its the night of all nights
Gotta look just right
Dressing to impress the boys

Do I want classic or vintage or plaid?
Wheres the mirror?
I think this tux is too baggy
Too tight, it makes me look weird.

Should I go movie star glamorous, sassy or sweet?
Dont know, but no one better wear the same dress as me
Its the night of our nightmares
Its the night of our dreams
Its too late to back out of it.
Hey, makeovers, massages.
Dont know what a corsage is.
Been waiting all our lives for this.

Its gonna be a night (cant wait)
To remember (aw man)
Come on now, big fun (alright)
Its gonna be the night (I guess)
To last forever (lucky us)
Well never ever ever forget

Gettin Ready, Get Gettin Ready
Gettin Ready, Get, Gettin Ready
(Hey you been in there an hour man)
So, what should I do with my hair?
Wheres my shaver?
Ooh, I love it.
I look like a waiter.
Should I fluff it?
Its get later already should be there.

Her mother opens the door, Im shakin inside
Hes here, its time, the hours arrived.
Dont know why, her fathers staring me down
Wheres my purse? Lip gloss? Now Im really freaking out.
Then something changes my world
The most beautiful girl right in front of my eyes

Its gonna be a night (Oh Yeah!)
To remember (Thats for sure)
Come on now, big fun (Alright!)
Its gonna be the night (Yeah tonight)
To last forever (forever more)
Well never ever ever forget.

Whos that girl? (Shes so fine)
Whos that guy? (I dont recognize)
Whos that girl? (She looks so good, yeah)
Youll never really notice, but you probably should

Big fun, on the night of nights (alright)
The night of nights, tonight
Lets dance
On the night of nights
You know were gonna do it right

Its gonna be a night to remember
Its gonna be the night to last forever
Its gonna be a night to remember
Its gonna be the night to last forever
(Last Forever)
Its gonna be our night (you know it)
To remember (all time)
Come on now, big fun (big fun)
Its gonna be the night (love it)
To last forever (the rest of our lives)
Well never ever ever forget

Its gonna be our night (oh yeah)
All together (say it loud)
Come on now, everyone (thats right)
Its gonna be a night (yeah tonight)
To remember (hear the crowd)
And never ever ever never ever ever never ever never ever ever forget!
