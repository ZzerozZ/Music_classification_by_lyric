                        Thank you, I'll say goodbye soon
 Though its the end of the world,
 Don't blame yourself now
 And if its true,
 I will surround you and give life to a world
 That's our own Thank you, I'll say goodbye now
 Though its the end of the world,
 Don't blame yourself
 And if its true,
 I will surround you and give life to a world
 That's our own Thank you, I'll say goodbye soon
 Though its the end of the world, don't blame yourself now
 And if its true,
 I will surround you and give life to a world
 That's our own Thank you, I'll say goodbye now
 Though its the end of the world, don't blame yourself
 And if its true,
 I will surround you and give life to a world
 That's our own
