                        Bài hát : Kiss This Love Goodbye - James Blunt

My one, true love,
You can guess what I've been thinking of?
God knows, we've tried
To stay together while our hearts divided
Put my boxes in the hall
I leave my keys behind
It might not be the end but now
Oh it's time, to kiss this love goodbye
To kiss this love goodbye

You get, our friends
I will find a little place to rent
Out here now, doing fine
And I’ll pretend you never crossed my mind
So take my photo off the wall
And renovate your life
One day we might meet but now
Oh it's time
To kiss this love goodbye
To kiss this love goodbye

I give you back your life
Darling please don’t cry
Just put my boxes in the hall
I leave my keys behind
It might not be the end
But now it's time
To kiss this love goodbye
To kiss this love goodbye

My one, true love
You can guess what I've been thinking of?
                        
                    |
