                        It happened the moment
 when you were revealed
 'cause you were a dream
 that should not have been a fantasy real
 You gave me this beating baby
 this ryhthm inside high
 well you made me feel good
 'n nice 'n feel lovely
 gave me paradise
 so... Shouldn't I reallize
 youre the highest of the high
 'n if you don't know then i'll say it
 so don't ever wonder
 don't ever wonder (x2) So tell me how long
 how long it's gonna take until you speak baby
 'cause I can't live my life
 without you here by my side ...... You gave me the feelin' feelin', in my life so Shouldn't I reallize
 youre the highest of the high
 'n if you don't know then i'll say it
 so don't ever wonder
 don't ever wonder (fade out)
