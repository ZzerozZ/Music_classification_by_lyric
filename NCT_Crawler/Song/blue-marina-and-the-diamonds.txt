                        Bài hát: Blue - Marina and the Diamonds

We’ve broken up and now I regret it
I said goodbye when I shouldn’t have said it
I even cried but I never meant it
And I don’t know why but I can’t forget it

Gimme love, gimme dreams, gimme a good self esteem
Gimme good and pure, what you waiting for?
Gimme everything, all your heart can bring
Something good and true
I don’t wanna feel Blue anymore (Blue)
I don’t wanna feel blue anymore (Blue)
Gimme, gimme...

Gimme one more night
One last goodbye
Let’s do it one last time
Let’s do it one last time
One more time

No, I don’t love you
No, I don’t care
I just want to be held when I’m scared
And all I want is one night with you
Just cause I’m selfish
I know it’s true

Gimme love, gimme dreams, gimme a good self esteem
Gimme good and pure, what you waiting for?
Gimme everything, all your heart can bring
Something good and true

I don’t wanna feel Blue anymore (Blue)
I don’t wanna feel blue anymore (Blue)
Gimme, gimme...

Gimme one more night
One last goodbye
Let’s do it one last time
Let’s do it one last time
One more time

I’m sick of looking after you
I need a man to hold on to
I’m bored of everything we do
But I just keep coming back to you
I’m sick of looking after you
I need a man to hold on to
I’m bored of everything we do
But I just keep coming back to you

For one more night
One last goodbye
Let’s do it one last time
Let’s do it one last time
One more time

Gimme love, gimme dreams
Gimme a good self esteem
Gimme good and pure, what you waiting for?
Gimme everything, all your heart can bring
Something good and true

I don’t wanna feel blue anymore (Blue)
I don’t wanna feel blue anymore (Blue)
Gimme, gimme, gimme anything
But blue, blue, blue, royal Blue
I just wanna know who I’m looking for (Blue)
Gimme, gimme, gimme anything but blue, blue, blue
                        
                    |
