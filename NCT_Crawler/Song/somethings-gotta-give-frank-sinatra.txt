                        When an irresistible force such as you
 Meets an old immovable object like me
 You can bet just as sure as you live Something's gotta give
 Something's gotta give
 Something's gotta give When an irrepressible smile such as yours
 Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
 Don't say no because I insist Somewhere, somehow
 Someone's gotta be kissed So, en garde, who knows what the fates might have in store
 From their vast mysterious sky
 I'll try hard ignorin' those lips that I adore
 But how long can anyone try? Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might
 Chances are some heavenly star-spangled night
 We'll find out just as sure as we live Something's gotta give
 Something's gotta give
 Something's gotta give Fight, fight, fight it with all of your might
 Chances are that some heavenly star-spangled night
 We'll find out just as sure as we live Something's gotta give
 Something's gotta give
 Something's gotta give Something's gotta give
 Something's gotta give Aww, let's tear it up
