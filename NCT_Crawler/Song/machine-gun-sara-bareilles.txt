                        Tell me off in a letter
 Completely ignore me
 Gettin' high off of saying
 Why you don't adore me?
 Baby, please I'm well versed
 In how I might be cursed
 I don't need it articulated Stand in line wastin'
 All of your time just to hate me
 Every dime gone to ways
 You can find that might bait me
 And drag me down Sight set proudly
 Bring me to the ground see
 You love to be somebody's enemy Maybe nobody loved you when you were young
 Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes
 Will you try it once, give up the machine gun?
 Machine gun, yeah Locked and loaded
 You're practically floating away now
 In your fortress you feel like
 You're more or less safe now
 But let me say I don't mean harm, oh
 But, baby, you'd be charming
 If you'd come undone, get back where you started from Maybe nobody loved you when you were young
 Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes
 Will you try it once, give up the machine gun?
 Machine gun Never mind how you've rationed your time
 And the battle is underway
 Maybe times are gonna change
 Don't just hide in the silence behind
 What you've really been trying to say What a skill, baby
 Aiming to kill me
 With words you don't mean Maybe nobody loved you when you were young
 Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes
 Will you try it once, give up the machine gun?
 Will you try it once, give up the machine gun?
 Will you try it once, give up the machine gun?
 Machine gun, yeah
