                        Title: Misery Loves My Company
Artist: Three Days Grace

I am in control
I haven''t lost my mind
I''m picking up the pieces of the past you left behind
.
I don''t need your condescending
Words about me looking lonely
I don''t need your arms to hold me
''Cause misery is waiting on me

I am not alone
Not beaten down just yet
I am not afraid
Of the voices in my head
And down the darkest road
Something follows me
I am not alone
''Cause misery loves my company
Misery loves my company
.
Leave me in the cold
You''d better run away
I''m gonna dig a hole
And bury all the memories we''ve made
.
I don''t need your condescending
Words about me looking lonely
I don''t need your arms to hold me
''Cause misery is waiting on me
.
I am not alone
Not beaten down just yet
I am not afraid
Of the voices in my head
And down the darkest road
Something follows me
I am not alone
''Cause misery loves my company
Misery loves my company
.
I am not alone
Not beaten down just yet
I am not afraid
Of the voices in my head
And down the darkest road
Something follows me
I am not alone
''Cause misery loves my company
Misery loves my company
