                        [Verse 1]
 Tied to a sallow heart
 Why does he want to bring me where he goes?
 Oh and to find out the reasons why
 It's enough to make you wanna try for one last night

 [Verse 2]
 Ghosts and silhouettes
 They take a piece of me, they want it all
 Oh but to wait in an empty room
 With the feeling that it's closing in

 [Chorus]
 I had a dream I was dying
 But I found nobody there
 And if one last night is all that we've been given
 Let's live it like we care
 For one last night
 For one last night

 [Verse 3]
 Broken upon the rocks
 Let the beating waves come drag me down
 Oh but to find out the reasons why
 It's enough to make you wanna try for one last night

 [Chorus]
 I had a dream I was dying
 But I found nobody there
 And if one last night is all that we've been given
 Let's live it like we care
 For one last night
 For one last night

 For one last night
 For one last night
 For one last night
                        
                    |
