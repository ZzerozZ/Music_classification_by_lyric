                        Streets are lined with people
 People who want to move, move, move
 How could all these people have so much to prove, prove, prove
 Oh I can only ask myself
 Oh where are you all going
 And won't you take me with you to
 Where all the sirens are blaring Uptight downtown
 I'll prove that's how to make the ground
 And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising
 Uptight downtown
 I'll prove that's how to make the ground
 And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising Streets are lined with people
 With nothing else to lose, lose, lose
 When did all these people decide to change their shoes, shoes, shoes
 Oh I can only ask myself
 Oh where are you all going
 And won't you take me with you to
 Where all the sirens are blaring Uptight downtown
 I'll prove that's how to make the ground
 And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising Uptight downtown
 I'll prove that's how to make the ground
 And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising Uptight
 Uptight
 Uptight
 Uptight
 Uptight
 Uptight
 Uptight downtown
 Uptight downtown
 Uptight downtown
 Uptight downtown Why are we fighting
 I don't understand
 Oh but the temperature is rising tonight
