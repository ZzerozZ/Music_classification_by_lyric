                        Bài hát: We Stitch These Wounds - Black Veil Brides

You kissed the lips of evil,
Two months is all the same.
I begged for the mans approval,
Pray to die in vain.

Sit down with thoughts alone now,
With blood these lyrics came.
Your words, they eat right through me,
Death could hear my shame.

The tears we've cried, this love has died,
You're by yourself with me tonight.
It's what we hide with every lie,
And stitch these wounds with me tonight.

I think of it each time I touch you,
Or every time I hear his name.
These walls will never crumble,
Here's our cause to blame.

Sit down with thoughts alone now,
With blood these lyrics came.
Your words, they eat right through me,
Death could hear my shame.

The tears we've cried, this love has died,
You're by yourself with me tonight.
It's what we hide with every lie,
And stitch these wounds with me tonight.

Liar, liar, liar, oh

The tears we've cried, this love has died,
You're by yourself with me tonight.
It's what we hide with every lie,
And stitch these wounds with me tonight.

The tears we've cried, this love has died,
You're by yourself with me tonight.
It's what we hide with every lie,
And stitch these wounds with me tonight.

Liar!
Liar!
Liar say goodbye!
