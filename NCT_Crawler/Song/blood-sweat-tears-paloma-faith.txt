                        You tell me I'm a handful,
 But believe me I know,
 My worst audience is my mirror,
 I put on quite a show,
 Don't think you're perfect either,
 But I love you anyway,
 It takes two imperfect people,
 To dance a sweet ballet,
 Oh if you lost your way,
 And it drove you crazy,
 You would still have me, we work together you see,
 Blood sweat and tears, blood sweat and tears,
 I know sometimes it will hurt,
 And you wanna hate me,
 But we can conquer the world, leave our footprints on earth,
 We'll put in blood sweat and tears, blood sweat and tears,
 I know it will never be easy,
 We'll become raddled, and drown in our own sorrow,
 But I know that it all will be worth it,
 If you don't believe then I'll be shouting,
 No, no, no!
 You think that you're my shadow,
 But you're glittering like gold,
 And when I take my mask off,
 It's you I want to hold,
 I thank you for your patience,
 But I am patient too,
 I will hold you up when you fall down,
 Even if you say I'm rude,
 Oh if you lost your way,
 And it drove you crazy,
 You would still have me, we work together you see,
 Blood sweat and tears, blood sweat and tears,
 I know sometimes it will hurt,
 And you wanna hate me,
 But we can conquer the world, leave our footprints on earth,
 We'll put in blood sweat and tears, blood sweat and tears,
 I know it will never be easy,
 We'll become raddled, and drown in our own sorrow,
 But I know that it all will be worth it,
 If you don't believe then I'll be shouting,
 No, no, no!
 Oh if you lost your way,
 And it drove you crazy,
 You would still have me, we work together you see,
 Blood sweat and tears, blood sweat and tears,
 Oh if you lost your way,
 And it drove you crazy,
 You would still have me, we work together you see,
 Blood sweat and tears, blood sweat and tears,
 I know sometimes it will hurt,
 And you wanna hate me,
 But we can conquer the world, leave our footprints on earth,
 We'll put in blood sweat and tears, blood sweat and tears,
