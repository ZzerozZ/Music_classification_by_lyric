                        Bài hát: Elan - Nightwish

Leave the sleep and let the springtime talk 
in tongues from the time before man 
listen to a daffodil tell her tale 
Let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn 
The meadows of heaven await harvest 
the cliffs unjumped cold waters untouched 
The elsewhere creatures yet unseen 
Finally your number came up 
Free fall awaits the brave. 

Come, taste the wine, race the blind 
we will guide you from the light, writing noughts till the end of time.. 
Come, surf the clouds, race the dark, 
it feeds from the runs undone, 
meet me where the cliff greets the sea... 

The answer to the riddle before your eyes 
is in dead leaves and fleeting skies 
returning swans and sedulous mice 
writings on the garden book 
in the minute of a lover's look. 
Building a sandcastle close to the shore 
A house of cards from a worn out deck. 
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm, 
writing lyric for the song 
only you can understand.. 

-Chorus- 

Riding hard every shooting star 
come to life open mind 
have a laugh at the orthodox, 
Come, drink deep, let the *** of mind seep, 
Travil with great Élan 
Dance a jig at the funeral... 

-Chorus-
                        
                    |
