                        I've been around the World - hey hey
 I've been around the World - hey hey In the kitchen where I'm cooking what is good for me
 Spices from the Globe
 Little by little is the finest meal
 It's half the type for hope
 Come and see You mix it all together in your dreams
 Ingredients from the Seven Seas, and I
 I'm realizing things ain't what they seem
 That's the riddle of it
 That's the spirit of it
 That's the power of life I've been around the World - round the world
 And I've seen it all - seen it all
 I've been around the World - round the world
 'Cause the wind will always rise or fall I've been around the World - round the world
 And I wanted to see - see it all
 I've been the only girl - round the world
 All surrounded by mystery In the living room I'm cleaning up from top to floor
 Place I love the most
 Wall is covered up with all my souvenirs
 I got from coast to coast
 Come and see You mix it all together in Your dreams
 Ingredients from the Seven Seas, and I
 I'm realizing things ain't what they seem
 That's the riddle of it
 That's the spirit of it
 That's the power of life I've been around the World - round the world
 And I've seen it all - seen it all
 I've been around the World - round the world
 'Cause the wind will always rise or fall I've been around the World - round the world
 And I wanted to see - see it all
 I've been the only girl - round the world
 All surrounded by mystery I'm still coming around
 I keep chasing dreams
 Girl I keep coming around
 Hey hey I keep coming around
 And I can never stop
 Girl I keep coming around
 'Cause if I do a lot Around around
 And around the World I've been around the World - round the world
 Hey hey - seen it all
 I've been around the World - round the world
 All surrounded by mystery I've been around the World - round the world
 And I've seen it all - seen it all
 I've been around the World - round the world Sun will always rise and fall - round the world
