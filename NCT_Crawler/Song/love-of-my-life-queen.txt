                        Bài hát: Love Of My Life - Queen

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love
And now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

You will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you
I still love you

Hurry back, hurry back
Please, bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
Love of my life
Love of my life
Yeah
