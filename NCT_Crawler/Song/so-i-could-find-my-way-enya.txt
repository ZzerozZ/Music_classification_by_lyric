                        Bài hát: So I Could Find My Way - Enya

A thousand dreams you gave to me
You held me high, you held me high
And all those years you guided me
So I could find my way

How long your love had sheltered me
You held me high, you held me high
A harbour holding back the sea
So I could find my way

So let me give this dream to you
Upon another shore
So let me give this dream to you
Each night and ever more

Yet only time keeps us apart
You held me high, you held me high
You’re in the shadows of my heart
So I can find my way

You held me high, you held me high

So let me give this dream to you
Upon another shore
So let me give this dream to you
Each night and ever more

A thousand dreams you gave to me
You held me high, you held me high
And all those years you guided me
So I could find my way

So I could find my way
                        
                    |
