                        Bài hát: Night Changes - One Direction

Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had
She's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She said it was something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

I'm only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about you lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of

Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Chasing her tonight, doubts are running ‘round her head
He's waiting, hides behind his cigarette
Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

I'm only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about you lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost

I'm only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about you lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes

It will never change, baby
We will never change, baby
It will never change me and you
