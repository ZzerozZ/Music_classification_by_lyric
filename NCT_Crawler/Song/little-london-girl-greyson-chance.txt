                        [Verse 1]
 I shut the door
 And I step outside
 It's close to midnight
 And the fog is in
 And the street lights With the sound of Big Ben
 It reminded me
 It was only yesterday
 When we first met in that cafe
 And our worlds entwined. [Chorus]
 Ooooh don't you know?
 I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby
 I'm ready to go.
 Ooooh don't you know?
 It doesn't matter if the sun is going down on me
 You light my world
 My little London girl. [Verse 2]
 Sunglasses on
 You take me to Camden Town
 As you share your headphones
 With the Kinks and the Rolling Stones.
 As you walk around
 In your leather boots
 All the boys are staring
 But you're not caring
 'Cuz you're so rock and roll (so rock and roll)
 Woahhh... [Chorus]
 Ooooh don't you know?
 I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby
 I'm ready to go.
 Ooooh don't you know?
 It doesn't matter if the sun is going down on me
 You light my world
 My little London girl. (Yeah) You light my world (x5)
 ... worlddd
 Ooooh don't you know?
 We're gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby
 Are you ready to go?
 Ooooh don't you know?
 You light my world
 My little London...
 Girlll don't you know?
 I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby
 I'm ready to go.
 Ooooh don't you know?
 It doesn't matter if the sun is going down on me
 You light my world
 My little London girl.
