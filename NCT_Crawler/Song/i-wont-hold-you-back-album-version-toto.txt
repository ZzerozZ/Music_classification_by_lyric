                        If I had another chance tonight
 I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
 Time can erase the love we shared
 But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared
 Now you're gone, I'm really not the same, I guess I held myself to blame
 Time can erase the things we said
 But it gives me time to realize that you're the one who's sad

 Chorus:
 You know I won't hold you back now, the love we had just can't be found
 You know I can't hold you back now

 Now that I'm alone it gives me time to think about the years that you were mine
 Time can erase the love we shared
 But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared

 Chorus

 [Instrumental]

 You know I won't hold you back now, the love we had just can't be found

 You know I can't hold you back now, the love we had just can't be found
                        
                    |
