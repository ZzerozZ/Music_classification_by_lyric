                        Oh yeah they tell me I'm a bad boy
 All the ladies look at me and act coy
 I just like to put my hands up in the air
 I want that girl dancing over there Look at her go on the dance floor
 She's amazing on the dance floor
 When she moves, girl, I want more
 Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
 You got me sayin'
 Go little bad girl, little bad girl [x3]
 Go little bad girl
 Go little bad girl Oh yeah they tell me I'm a bad boy,
 All the ladies look at me and act coy
 I just like to put my hands up in the air
 I want that girl dancing over there Shaking her ass from the left to the right
 Moving it round just the way that I like
 I wanna see you move like a movie on flight
 She got it how I want it and I want it all night Look at her go on the dance floor
 She's amazing on the dance floor
 When she moves, girl, I want more
 Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
 You got me sayin'
 Go little bad girl, little bad girl [x3]
 Go little bad girl (let's go)
 Go little bad girl She got my heart jumping
 And my adrenaline pumpin' and gunnin'
 Like ain't nobody ever seen (seen...)
 'Matter of fact I've seen this woman all up in my dreams
 Whippin' and flippin' and stackin' and slappin'
 I'm attacking after she back it up and make it drop
 After I meet her I tell her David Guetta's on the track, baby girl, don't stop
 Keep it goin' you never know when somebody's gonna throw a couple dollars
 Got a pocket full of hundred dollar bill's Ludacris mr. make-a-woman-hollar
 And every night on the floor putting on a show (show...)
 Everybody in the club there's a little something you should know Look at her go on the dance floor
 She's amazing on the dance floor
 When she moves, girl, I want more
 Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
 You got me sayin'
 Go little bad girl, little bad girl [x3]
 Go little bad girl
 Go little bad girl
 Go little bad girl, little bad girl [x3]
 Go little bad girl
 Go little bad girl.
