                        Bài hát: A Winter'S Tale - David Essex

The nights are colder now
Maybe, I should close the door
And anyway the snow has covered all your footsteps
And I can follow you no more

The fire still burns at night
My memories are warm and clear
But everybody knows it's hard
To be alone at this time of year

It was only a winter's tale
Just another winter's tale
And why should the world take notice
Of one more love that's failed?

A love that could never be
Though it meant a lot to you and me
On a world wide scale we're just another winter's tale

While I stand alone
A bell is ringing far away
I wonder if you hear, I wonder if you're listening
I wonder where you are today

Good luck, I wish you well
For all that wishes may be worth
I hope that love and strength are with you
For the length of your time on earth

It was only a winter's tale
Just another winter's tale
And why should the world take notice
Of one more love that's failed?

It's a love that could never be
Though it meant a lot to you and me
On a world wide scale we're just another winter's tale

It was only a winter's tale
Just another winter's tale
And why should the world take notice
Of one more love that's failed?

It's a love that could never be
Though it meant a lot to you and me
On a world wide scale we're just another winter's tale
                        
                    |
