                        Bài hát: Come And Get It (Razihel Remix) - Krewella

Pull my heart out of my chest 
Train my mind so I forget 
Sink your teeth into my bones
Dig me out then fill the hole

Tear me apart
Tear me apart and watch it burn
Tear me apart
Tear me apart and watch it burn

All thats left is a window to my soul
Falling faster you made my heart your home

Come and get it one more time (whoa)
If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it one more time (whoa) 
If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it

If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it

If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it

Come and get it one more time (whoa)
If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it one more time (whoa) 
If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it

If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it
Come and get it.. [repeat and fade]

Mouth to mouth I breathe you in
Swallow down your jagged sin
Let it drown inside my veins
The sweetest poison I could take

You make it an art
The way that you scar with every word
But before we reach the end
Strip me down again

Come and get it one more time (whoa)
If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it one more time (whoa) 
If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it

Come and get it

If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it

If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it one more time (whoa)
If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
Come and get it one more time (whoa)
If you wanna lose your mind (whoa)
Come and get it.. [repeat and fade]
