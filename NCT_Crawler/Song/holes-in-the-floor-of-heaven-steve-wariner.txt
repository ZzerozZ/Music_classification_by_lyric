                        Song: Holes In The Floor Of Heaven - Steve Wariner

One day shy of eight years old
 Grandma passed away
 I was a broken hearted little boy
 Blowing out that birthday cake How I cried when the sky let go
 With a cold and lonesome rain
 Momma smiled, said, "Don't be sad child
 Grandma's watchin' you today" 'Cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven
 And her tears are pourin' down
 That's how you know she's watchin'
 Wishin' she could be here now And sometimes if you're lonely
 Just remember she can see
 There's holes in the floor of Heaven
 And she's watchin' over you and me Seasons come and seasons go
 Nothin' stays the same
 I grew up, fell in love
 Met a girl who took my name Year by year we made a life
 In this sleepy little town
 I thought we'd grow old together
 Lord I sure do miss her now But there's holes in the floor of Heaven
 And her tears are pourin' down
 That's how I know she's watchin'
 Wishin' she could be here now And sometimes when I'm lonely
 I remember she can see
 There's holes in the floor of Heaven
 And she's watchin' over you and me Well my little girl is 23
 I walk her down the aisle
 It's a shame her mom can't be here now
 To see her lovely smile They throw the rice, I catch her eye
 As the rain starts comin' down
 She takes my hand says, "Daddy don't be sad
 'Cause I know Momma's watchin' now" And there's holes in the floor of Heaven
 And her tears are pourin' down
 That's how you know she's watchin'
 Wishin' she could be here now And sometimes when I'm lonely
 I remember she can see
 Yes, there's holes in the floor of Heaven
 And she's watchin' over you and me Watchin' over you and me
 Watchin' over you and me
 Watchin' over you and me
