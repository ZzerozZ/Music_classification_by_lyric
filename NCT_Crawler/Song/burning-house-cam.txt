                        Bài hát: Burning House - CAM

I had a dream about a burning house 
You were stuck inside 
I couldn't get you out 
I lay beside you and pulled you close 
And the two of us went up in smoke 
Love isn't all that it seems 

I did you wrong 
I'll stay here with you 
Until this dream is gone 
I've been sleepwalking 
Been wondering all night 
Trying to take what's lost and broke 

And make it right 
I've been sleepwalking 
Too close to the fire 
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight 
In this burning house 
I see you at a party and you look the same 

I could take you back 
But people don't really change 
Wish that we could go back in time 
I'd be the one you thought you'd find 
Love isn't all that it seems 
I did you wrong 

I'll stay here with you 
Till this dream is gone 
I've been sleepwalking 
Been wondering all night 
Trying to take what's lost and broke 
And make it right 
I've been sleepwalking 
Too close to the fire 

But it's the only place that I can hold you tight 
In this burning house 
Flames are getting bigger now 
In this burning house 
I can hold on to you somehow 
In this burning house 

Oh and I don't wanna wake up 
In this burning house 
And I've been sleepwalking 
Been wandering all night 
Trying to take what's lost and broke 

And make it right 
I've been sleep walking 
Too close to the fire 
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight 
In this burning house
                        
                    |
