                        Bài hát: Power Of The Empire - Empire Cast, Yazz

I wanna reign over my Empire like Caesar
I wanna walk over water and die like Jesus
I want a G5 Learjet fully loaded, all new features
It's easy to travel the world with a lifetime Visa

T-t-time of the essence
Hot damn it keep me focused
(Keep me focused, keep me focused)
My mind is a weapon
(Is a weapon)
I gotta keep it loaded
(Keep it loaded, keep it loaded)

They all wanna see you
Whenever you make it
They all wanna come when
Your name in the papers
The more that you give 'em
The more that they taking
So you gotta remember
To cover the basics

Power, for the power
Power, all for the power
Power, for the power
Power, all for the power
Power of the empire
For the power, of the empire
I'll do anything for the power
Of the empire, of the empire

Lie, cheat, steal, fight
Just to get home for the night
(I'll do anything for the power)
Lie, cheat, steal, fight
Just to get home for the night
(I'll do anything for the power)

I want everybody at attention
You can call me Mr. Lyon
When I visit, When I visit
If money is the root to all evil
You can see me ball
People never see me fall
Cause I got the power

T-t-time of the essence
Hot damn it keep me focused
(Keep me focused, keep me focused)
My mind is a weapon
I gotta keep it loaded
(Keep it loaded, keep it loaded)

They all wanna see you
Whenever you make it
They all wanna come when
Your name in the papers
The more that you give 'em
The more that they taking
So you gotta remember
To cover the basics

Power, for the power
Power, all for the power
Power, for the power
Power, all for the power
Power of the empire
For the power
I'll do anything for the power
Of the empire, of the empire

Lie, cheat, steal, fight
Just to get home for the night
(I'll do anything for the power)
Lie, cheat, steal, fight
Just to get home for the night
(I'll do anything for the power)

I want everybody at attention
You can call me Mr. Lyon
When I visit, when I visit
If money is the root to all evil
You can see me ball
People never see me fall
Cause I got the power

Power, for the power
Power, all for the power
Power, for the power
Power, all for the power
Power of the empire
For the power
I'll do anything for the power
(It's mine)
Of the empire, of the empire

Lie, cheat, steal, fight
Just to get home for the night
(I'll do anything for the power)
Lie, cheat, steal, fight
Just to get home for the night
(I'll do anything for the power)

I want everybody at attention
You can call me Mr. Lyon
When I visit, when I visit
(I'll do anything for the power)
If money is the root to all evil
You can see me ball
People never see me fall
Cause I got the power
