                        Bài hát: Dont Stop Believin - Journey

Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world 
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere 
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit 
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere 

A singer in a smokey room 
A smell of wine and cheap perfume 
For a smile they can share the night 
It goes on and on and on and on 

(Chorus) 
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard 
Their shadows searching in the night 
Streetlights people, living just to find emotion 
Hiding, somewhere in the night. 

Working hard to get my fill, 
Everybody wants a thrill 
Payin' anything to roll the dice, 
Just one more time 
Some will win, some will lose 
Some were born to sing the blues 
Oh, the movie never ends 
It goes on and on and on and on 

(Chorus) 

Don't stop believin' 
Hold on to the feelin' 
Streetlights people 

Don't stop believin' 
Hold on 
Streetlight people 

Don't stop believin' 
Hold on to the feelin' 
Streetlights people
                        
                    |
