                        Bài hát: So Far Away - Red

I am right here with you
I couldn't be more close
Pretending that I'm in this moment,
When I'm only a ghost

I listen to the words you're saying
Words I'm fighting to believe
It's like I'm living from a distance
When you're out of reach

I wanna feel it,
When I mean it,
When I say it,
Can you hear me at all?

And I feel so far away, far away from everything
Outside wondering when I got lost
I threw my arms up in the air, why do I disappear
How can your love be so close
When I'm so far away?

Remember when you found me drowning
You pulled me from the deepest end
I promised that I'll never leave you
Now I'm drowning again

It's killing me with every breath
Witnessing the life I lived
Only you know who I am
I'm reaching out my hand

I wanna feel it,
When I mean it,
When I say it,
Can you hear me at all?

And I feel so far away, far away from everything
Outside wondering when I got lost
I threw my arms up in the air, why do I disappear?
How can your love be so close,
When I'm so far away?

I'm so far away [x5]
Yeeeah yeeeeah

And I don't wanna waste time
Living a half-life
Are you listening?
Now give it back to me!
I remember everything
The way it used to be.
Yeah give it back to me
Yeah give it back to me
I hear your voice
But inside I'm lost.

And I feel so far away, far away from everything
Outside wondering when I got lost
I threw my arms up in the air, why do I disappear
How can your love be so close,
When I'm so far away?

I'm so far away
I'm so far away
                        
                    |
