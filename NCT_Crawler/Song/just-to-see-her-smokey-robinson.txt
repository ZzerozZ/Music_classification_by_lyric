                        Just to see her, just to touch her
 Just to hold her in my arms again one more time
 If I could feel her warm embrace see her smiling face
 Can't find anyone to take her place I've got to see her again I would do anything, I would go anywhere
 There's nothing I wouldn't do just to see her again I can't hide it, I can't fight it
 It's so hard to live without the love she gave to me
 Doesn't she know it, I tried hard not to show it
 Can't I make her realize that she really needs me again I would do anything, I would go anywhere
 There's nothing I wouldn't do just to see her again
 She brightened up my everyday made me feel so good in every way
 If I could have her back to stay, I've got to see her again
