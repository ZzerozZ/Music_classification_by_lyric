                        Bài hát: When I Dream - Carol Kidd

I could build a mansion that is higher than the trees
I could have all the gifts I want and never ask please
I could fly to Paris, it's at my beck and call
Why do I live my life alone with nothing at all?

But when I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true
When I dream, I dream of you 
Maybe someday you will come true

I can be the singer or the clown in any room
I can call up someone to take me to the moon
I can put my makeup on and drive the men insane
I can go to bed alone and never know his name

But when I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true
When I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true
                        
                    |
