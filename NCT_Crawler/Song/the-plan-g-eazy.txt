I thought this was always the plan
What were you doing?
What do you mean?
There's only one way
There's only one option
There's only one route to get there, you know?

It's not going to make itself
When you wake up and you check the Chase App
And this *** got more and more digits than a license plate
Them seven-eight figures don't make themselves, yadadamean?
You gotta get it!
This was always the plan
