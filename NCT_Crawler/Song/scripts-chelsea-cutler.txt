                        Bài hát: Scripts - Chelsea Cutler

I take my medicine at 8 p.m. with water
'Cause the doctor told me it would be my key
Couple addys in the morning make me stronger
Couple k-pins before bed to make me weak

I know you gave me hell
But you got me so addicted
I can't help but stay missing you
I'm anxious 'bout myself
Running through all my prescriptions
I need something else to abuse

You were my drug
My only plug
Doing 80 in my veins can't get enough
You were my drug
Got so caught up
Now I'm trying to use the last of all your love

I'm taking all the pictures of you off of my walls
I'm rolling up and burning all the evidence
No one warned me
No one told me how hard I'd fall
Now nothing gets me higher than the low I've been

I know you gave me hell
But you got me so addicted
I can't help but stay missing you, yeah
I'm anxious 'bout myself
Running through all my prescriptions
I need something else to abuse

You were my drug
My only plug
Doing 80 in my veins can't get enough
You were my drug
Got so caught up
Now I'm trying to use the last of all your love

Yeah, I know you gave me hell
But you got me so addicted
I can't help but stay missing you
I'm anxious 'bout myself
Running through all my prescriptions
I need something else to abuse

You were my drug
My only plug
Doing 80 in my veins can't get enough
You were my drug
Got so caught up
Now I'm trying to use the last of all your love
