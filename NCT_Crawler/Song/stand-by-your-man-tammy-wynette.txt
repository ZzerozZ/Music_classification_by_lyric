                        STAND BY YOUR MAN

Sometimes its hard to be a woman
 Giving all your love to just one man
 You'll have bad times
 And he'll have good times
 Doing things that you don't understand

 But if you love him you'll forgive him
 Even though he's hard to understand
 And if you love him
 Oh be proud of him
 'Cause after all he's just a man

 Stand by your man
 Give him two arms to cling to
 And something warm to come to
 When nights are cold and lonely

 Stand by your man
 And tell the world you love him
 Keep giving all the love you can
 Stand by your man

 Stand by your man
 And show the world you love him
 Keep giving all the love you can
 Stand by your man
                        
                    |
