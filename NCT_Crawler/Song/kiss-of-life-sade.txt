                        There must have been an angel by my side
 Something heavenly led me to you
 Look at the sky
 It's the color of love There must have been an angel by my side
 Something heavenly came down from above
 He led me to you
 He led me to you He built a bridge to your heart
 All the way
 How many tons of love inside
 I can't say When I was led to you
 I knew you were the one for me
 I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
 When I lay eyes on you
 Ay ay ay
 You wrapped me up in
 The color of love You gave me the kiss of life
 Kiss of life
 You gave me the kiss that's like
 The kiss of life Wasn't it clear from the start
 Look the sky is full of love
 Yeah the sky is full of love You gave me the kiss of life
 Kiss of life
 You gave me the kiss that's like
 The kiss of life You gave me the kiss of life
 Kiss of life
 You gave me the kiss that's like
 The kiss of life You wrapped me up in the color of love
 Must have been an angel came down from above
 Giving me love yeah
 Giving me love yeah You gave me the kiss of life
 Kiss of life
 You gave me the kiss of life
 Kiss of life
