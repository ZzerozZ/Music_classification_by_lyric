                        There's a house fly swimming in my sweet tea 
Hey darlin' pass another Kerr jar to me 
Butter drippin' off a biscuit, baby better take a bite 
Cantaloupe thumps like it's finaly ripe 
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin' in swamp air 
200 mile marker signs from nowhere 
That's what country is

[Chorus:] 
It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall 
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall 
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss 
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton 
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten 
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips 
That's what country is

When the sun starts slippin' from the delta sky 
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night 
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank 
'Bout an hour till we feel the first catfish yank 
Barefoot cane pole wavin' at the riverboats 
They when they're gone take a dip in the moon glow 
That's what country is

[Chorus]

It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture 
It's cars pulling over for a no cab tractor 
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips 
No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with 
That's what country is [x4]
                        
                    |
