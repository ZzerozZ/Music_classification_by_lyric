                        There's a long hard road ahead
 But a voice inside me said You know there's something, oh, that you need to know
 It's gonna be alright
 Said there's something that you need to know
 It's gonna be alright When in this life, in this life
 When I can only turn my chin
 I know it's gonna be alright
 When this big old town is closing in
 And I have lost again, oh no Here I could stay but I'll keep moving on
 Here I could stay but I'll keep moving on
 Could be I won't be wrong There's a long hard road ahead
 But a voice inside me said Said there's something, oh, that you need to know
 It's gonna be alright
 Said there's something that you need to know
 It's gonna be alright
