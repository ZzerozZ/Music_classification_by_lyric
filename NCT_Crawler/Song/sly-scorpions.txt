                        She was born with a song in the air
In the summer of 85
The clouds just went and the day became so bright
A child of love angel like
With the most beautiful smile
Growing up to be the sunshine of my life

Come talk to me
Don't run away
Don't let the distance grow
The door's wide open
Don't ever think
There is no way home

Sly come home tonight
The world is so bad you're drive 'em all mad
With your smile
Sly my joy and pride
When the runaway train took you away
A part of me died

The years went by like the summer of love
So much changed in our lives
They're too may scars deep under my skin
Love turned to hate and hate to love
Let's start all over again
And now I wonder what life will bring

Just let us laugh
The tears away
No more hard feelings no
Cause after all
You're my flesh and blood
I don't want you to fall

Sly come home tonight
The world is so bad you're drive 'em all mad
With your smile
Sly my joy and pride
When the runaway train took you away
A part of me died
                        
                    |
