                        Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
 Mmm
 Uh huh I was down at the New Amsterdam
 Staring at this yellow-haired girl
 Mr Jones strikes up a conversation
 With a black-haired flamenco dancer
 You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
 She's suddenly beautiful
 We all want something beautiful
 Man, I wish I was beautiful So come dance the silence down through the morning
 Sha la, la, la, la, la, la, la
 Yeah
 Uh huh
 Yeah Cut up, Maria!
 Show me some of that Spanish dancin'
 Pass me a bottle, Mr Jones
 Believe in me
 Help me believe in anything
 'Cause I want to be someone who believes
 Yeah Mr Jones and me
 Tell each other fairy tales
 And we stare at the beautiful women
 She's looking at you
 Ah, no, no, she's looking at me
 Smilin' in the bright lights
 Coming through in stereo
 When everybody loves you
 You can never be lonely Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
 Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
 All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
 Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
 I felt so symbolic yesterday
 If I knew Picasso
 I would buy myself a gray guitar and play Mr Jones and me
 Look into the future
 Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
 She's looking at you
 I don't think so
 She's looking at me
 Standing in the spotlight
 I bought myself a gray guitar
 When everybody loves me
 I will never be lonely
 I will never be lonely
 Said I'm never gonna be
 Lonely I wanna be a lion
 Yeah, everybody wants to pass as cats
 We all wanna be big, big stars
 Yeah, but we got different reasons for that
 Believe in me
 'Cause I don't believe in anything
 And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe
 Yeah! Mr Jones and me
 Stumbling through the Barrio
 Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
 She's perfect for you
 Man, there's got to be somebody for me
 I wanna be Bob Dylan
 Mr Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
 When everybody love you
 Oh! Son, that's just about as funky as you can be Mr Jones and me
 Starin' at the video
 When I look at the television, I wanna see me
 Staring right back at me
 We all wanna be big stars
 But we don't know why, and we don't know how
 But when everybody loves me
 I'm wanna be just about as happy as I can be
 Mr Jones and me
 We're gonna be big stars
