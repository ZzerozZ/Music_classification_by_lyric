                        [Verse 1] 
It's been said and done 
Every beautiful thought's been already sung 
And I guess right now here's another one 
So your melody will play on and on, with best we own 
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible 
A center full of miracle, lyrical 
You've saved my life again 
And I want you to know baby 

[Chorus] 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 

And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat 

I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 

And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat 

[Verse 2] 
Cursing me, boy you played through my mind like a symphony 
There's no way to describe what you do to me 
You just do to me, what you do 
And it feels like I've been rescued 
I've been set free 
I am hyptonized by your destiny 
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful 
You are...I want you to know baby 

[Chorus] 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 

And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat 

I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 

And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat 

[Bridge] 
No one can pause 
You stand alone, to every record I own 
Music to my hear that's what you are 
A song that goes on and on 

[Chorus] 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 

And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat 

I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 
I, I love you like a love song, baby 

I love you...like a love song...
                        
                    |
