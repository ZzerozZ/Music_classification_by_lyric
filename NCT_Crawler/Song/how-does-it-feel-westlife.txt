                        Bài hát: How Does It Feel - Westlife

[Shane:]
True lovers never take it slowly
When they've found the one and only
Nothing can replace this feeling
Knowing someone loves you

It's painted with the pain and glory
Taking from a known sad story
Laying out my life before me
Fearing the unknown

Sharing never showed me much appeal
And now I'm only praying it's for real

[All:]
So how does it feel
When I hold you in my arms
And you're lying next to me
Never wanting you to leave
Until I'll tell you how it feels
To be cradled like my dreams
And to know that you love me
No more wasting time in asking other people
How does it feel

[Shane:]
How does it feel

[Bryan:]
Forever taken you for granted
You give me everything I wanted
I'm so afraid that I might lose you
But time will let us see
If everything is real I'm feeling
Well maybe we've been only dreaming
And if it's gonna die to save it
Cos baby I believe

Nothing in the world could make it right
Cos baby loving you brings me to life

[All:]
And how does it feel
When I hold you in my arms
And you're lying next to me
Never wanting you to leave
Until I'll tell you how it feels
To be cradled like my dreams
And to know that you love me
No more wasting time in asking other people
How does it feel

[Bryan:]
Woah, woah, woah

[Shane:]
Nothing in the world could feel this right
Cos baby you're the best thing in my life

[All:]
How does it feel
When I hold you in my arms
And you're lying next to me
Never wanting you to leave
Until I'll tell you how it feels
To be cradled like my dreams
And to know that you love me
No more wasting time in asking other people

[Shane:]
How does it feel
                        
                    |
