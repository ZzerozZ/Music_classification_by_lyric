                        [Chorus:]
Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Turn the music up, let's do it 
C'mon people let's get loud 
Let's get loud 
Turn the music up to hear that sound 
Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya 
What you gotta do 

If you wanna live your life 
Live it all the way and don't you waste it 
Every feelin' every beat 
Can be so very sweet you gotta taste it 
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say 
Life's a party, make it hot 
Dance don't ever stop, whatever rhythm 
Every minute, every day 
Take them all the way you gotta live 'em ('cause I'm going to live my life)
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say 
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say 

[Chorus:]
Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Turn the music up to hear that sound 
Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Ain't nobody gotta tell you 
What you gotta do 

[Break]
Life is meant to be big fun 
You're not hurtin' anyone 
Nobody loses 
Let the music make you free
Be what you wanna be 
Make no excuses 
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
To gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say 
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say
                        
                    |
