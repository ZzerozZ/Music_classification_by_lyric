                        Bài hát: No Roots (Single Version) - Alice Merton

I like digging holes and, hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I hope I won't forget to find them
Cause, I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night.
I build a home and wait for, someone to tear it down

Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
Cause, I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night.
And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times.

I've got no roots
But my home, was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home, was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
But my home, was never on the ground

I've got no roots
But my home, was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
I like standing still, but that's just a wishful plan

Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and, travel like gypsies in the night
I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
But I've got memories and, travel like gypsies in the night
                        
                    |
