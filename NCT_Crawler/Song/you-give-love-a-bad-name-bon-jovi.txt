                        Shot through the heart 
And you're to blame 
Darlin' 
You give love a bad name 

An angel's smile is what you sell 
You promise me heaven, then put me through Hell 
Chains of love got a hold on me 
When passions a prison, you can't break free 

Oh, you're a loaded gun, yeah 
Oh, there's nowhere to run 
No one can save me 
The damage is done 

Shot through the heart 
And you're to blame 
You give love a bad name (bad name) 
I play my part and you play your game 
You give love a bad name (bad name) 
You give love, a bad name 

Paint your smile on your lips 
Blood red nails on your fingertips 
A school boy's dream, you act so shy 
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye 

Oh, you're a loaded gun 
Oh, there's nowhere to run 
No one can save me 
The damage is done 

Shot through the heart 
And you're to blame 
You give love a bad name (bad name) 
I play my part and you play your game 
You give love a bad name (bad name) 
You give love, oh! 

[Guitar Solo] 

Oh! 
Shot through the heart 
And you're to blame 
You give love a bad name 
I play my part and you play your game 
You give love a bad name (bad name) 

Shot through the heart 
And you're to blame 
You give love a bad name (bad name) 
I play my part and you play your game 
You give love a bad name (bad name) 
You give love 
You give love (bad name) 
You give love 
You give love (bad name) 
You give love 
You give love (bad name) 
You give love
