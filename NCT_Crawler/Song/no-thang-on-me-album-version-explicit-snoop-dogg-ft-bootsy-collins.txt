                        You know, I've been around the world and ai ai ai
 I've met a lot of people
 And what I've come to find out is that people are the same
 They all share the same fears, share the same tears
 And die over the years
 So, I'm just gon' be thankful to get what I got
 And hold onto what I have, can you dig that?
 And what I do, I do for the benefit of me and my kids
 Dig that, talk to me I'm so glad I've got my own
 So glad that I can see
 My life's a natural high
 And they can't put no thang on me I'm so glad I've got my own
 So glad that I can see
 My life's a natural high
 And they can't put no thang on me It's something kind of funny
 How the man take your money
 Be sure as he can be
 In such a way you'll never see It's a terrible thing inside
 When your natural high has died
 What we can't turn to dope
 And put all aside the hope I'm so glad I've got my own
 So glad that I can see
 My life's a natural high
 And they can't put no thang on me I'm so glad I've got my own
 So glad that I can see
 My life's a natural high
 And they can't put no thang on me Twinkling tinkling braids
 We do all sorts of things
 While you're in a modest place
 Your conscious is only peace Yeah, I had to make peace with myself, you know what I mean?
 I been getting high for the what last past fifteen, twenty years
 So I told myself I wanna know what it feels like to be high for life
 And I mean man, I tell you it feels real good
 You know, coaching your lil' kids out there on the football field
 Doing my thug thizzle still but you know
 Just being high for life is a different feeling
 You should try it my brother, I'm telling you it's a great feeling
 Can you dig that? More and more you grieve
 Until you grow another need
 You claim this fantasy
 You'll have no reality I'm so glad I've got my own
 So glad that I can see
 My life's a natural high
 And they can't put no thang on me I'm so glad I've got my own
 So glad that I can see
 My life's a natural high
 And they can't put no thang on me Darling take a listen
 This may be something that your missin'
 I know your times are funky
 But you don't have to be no junkie Just be glad you've got your own
 So glad that I can see
 My life's a natural high
 And they can't put no thang on me I'm so glad I've got my own
 So glad that I can see
 My life's a natural high
 And they can't put no thang on me [Incomprehensible]
