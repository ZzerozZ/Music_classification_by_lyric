Talk to me

Your touch is so magic to me
The strangest things can happen
The way that you react to me
I wanna do something you can't imagine
Imagine if there was a million me's talking sexy to you like that
You think you can handle, boy
If I give you my squeeze and I need you to push it right back

Baby, show me, show me
What's your favorite trick that you wanna use on me
And I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowing and going
Till clothing disappears, ain't nothing but shoes on me
Oh, baby

All night, show it, just you and the crowd
Doing tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around you
I bet you know what I mean
Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

Everything ain't what it seems
I wave my hands and I got you
And you feel so fly assisting me
But now it's my turn to watch you
I ain't gonna stop you if you wanna crowd my neck
Talk sexy to me like that
Just do what I taught you, girl
When I give you my heat and I need you to push it right back

Baby, show me, show me
What's your favorite trick that you wanna use on me
And I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowing and going
Till clothing disappears, ain't nothing but shoes on me
Oh, baby

All night, show it, just you and the crowd
Doing tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around you
I bet you know what I mean
Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

Oh, this is the part where we fall in love
Oh, let's slow it down so we fall in love
But don't stop what you're doing to me

Ciara

All night, show it, just you and the crowd
Doing tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love sex magic
So let me drive my body around you
I bet you know what I mean
Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

All night, show it, just you and the crowd
Doing tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around you
I bet you know what I mean
Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

see you on the floor
give me girl
love and sex and magic
see you on the floor
you know what I mean
give me girl
I bet them like and make you believe
and love and sex and magic
see you on the floor
see you on the floor
give me girl
