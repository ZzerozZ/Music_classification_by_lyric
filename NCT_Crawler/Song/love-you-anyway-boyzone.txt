                        Bài hát: Love You Anyway - Boyzone

Tell me what you want from me,
So I can try to make you see,
That I’m in no position for giving.
‘Cos all I see you do is lie,
And I can’t help but close my eyes,
And wonder ‘bout you in my life,
I’m drowning in your tears.

I’m delirious,
Are you serious?
What goes on in your head,
I’m just curious.
‘Cos I’m hanging here,
Got me dangled here.
Think your love, oh your love has got off my head.

It’s unbelievably hard to love you,
But I love you anyway.
I’ve been trying too hard not to love you,
But I love you anyway.

Oh, I should’ve known,
That you’d go and steal my eyes.
Oh, I should’ve known,
From then on I’d lose my life.

I’m delirious,
Are you serious?
What goes on in your head,
I’m just curious.
‘Cos I’m hanging here,
Got me dangled here,
Think your love, oh your love has got off my head.

It’s unbelievably hard to love you,
But I love you anyway.
I’ve been trying too hard not to love you,
But I love you anyway.
It’s so incredibly hard to love you,
But I love you anyway.
And every time I try too hard not to love you,
I love you anyway.

I don’t get it, I really don’t get it,
I try to walk away but my feet won’t let me.
I don’t get it, I just don’t get it,
I try to walk away but my feet won’t let me.

You have me baby,
You drive me crazy.
You hear me baby?
You drive me crazy.

It’s unbelievably hard to love you,
But I love you anyway.
I’ve been trying too hard not to love you,
But I love you anyway.
(You have me baby)
It’s so incredibly hard to love you,
(You drive me crazy)
But I love you anyway.
Every time I try to hard not to love you,
I love you anyway.

I don’t get it, I really don’t get it,
I try to walk away but my feet won’t let me.
I don’t get it, I just don’t get it,
I try to walk away but my feet won’t let me.
