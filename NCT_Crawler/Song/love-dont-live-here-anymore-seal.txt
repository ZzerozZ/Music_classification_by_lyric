                        Bài hát: Love Don't Live Here Anymore - Seal

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothin' I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before you went away
Found another place to stay, another home

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy, babe
Love don't live here anymore

In the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd you have to go away?
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love?

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy, babe
Love don't live here anymore

No, no, no
You abandoned me
Love don't live here, live here, no, no

Just a vacancy, babe
Love no more
                        
                    |
