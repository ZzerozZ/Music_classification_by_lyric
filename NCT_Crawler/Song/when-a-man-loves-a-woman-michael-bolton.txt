                        When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For a good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be


When a man loves a woman
I gave you everything I got
Trying to hold on
To your heartless love
Baby Baby please don't treat me bad


When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see


Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby
When a man loves a woman 
When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman
When a man, when a man, when a man loves a woman
                        
                    |
