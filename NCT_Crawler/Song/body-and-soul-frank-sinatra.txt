Blues/Jazz|

                        My heart is sad and lonely
 For you I sigh, just for you only,
 Why haven't you seen it?
 I'm all for you, body and soul!

 I spent my days in longing
 And wondering why, why it's me that you're wronging?
 I tell you that I mean it
 I'm all for you, body and soul!

 I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
 That you turn away romance
 Are you pretending? Because it looks like the ending
 Unless I could have one more chance to prove dear...

 My life a wreck you're making
 You know I'm yours just for the taking
 I would gladly surrender,
 Surrender myself to you, body and soul!

 ...

 My life a wreck you're making
 You know I'm yours, I'm yours for just the taking
 I would gladly surrender... Myself to you
 Body and soul!...
