                        My love, now you're lyin' lonesome
 With visions of blue, vision in you
 Again, you let your heart go
 And whenever you do, it's hurting me too
 When damage is done I watch you run
 It's me you call, to me you come.
 Kisses and tears my one and only
 Don't be lonely, I'm right here
 Kisses and tears will turn a bad dream
 To a good thing, it's so clear
 Kisses and tears, you worth waiting
 That we created with our love
 Kisses and tears my one and only
 Don't be lonely, don't you run
 You know, how our heartache ends
 With visions of blue abandoning you
 I know that we're more than friends
 You, you know that it's true, it's long overdue
 No more to run, no damage done
 Now here my call, to you I come
 Kisses and tears my one and only
 Don't be lonely, I'm right here
 Kisses and tears will turn a bad dream
 To a good thing, it's so clear
 Kisses and tears, you worth waiting
 That we created with our love
 Kisses and tears my one and only
 Don't be lonely, don't you run
 Kisses and tears my one and only
 Don't be lonely, I'm right here
 Kisses and tears will turn a bad dream
 To a good thing, it's so clear
 Kisses and tears my one and only
 Don't be lonely, I'm right here
 Kisses and tears will turn a bad dream
 To a good thing, it's so clear
 Kisses and tears, you worth waiting
 That we created with our love
 Kisses and tears my one and only
 Don't be lonely, don't you run
