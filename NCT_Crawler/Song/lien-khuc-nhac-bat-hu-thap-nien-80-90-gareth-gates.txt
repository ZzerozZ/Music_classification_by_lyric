                        I've been letting you down, down
Girl I know I've been such a fool
Giving in to temptation
I should've played it cool

The situation got out of hand
I hope you understand

It could happen to anyone of us
Anyone you think of
Anyone can fall
Anyone can hurt someone they love

Hearts will break
'Cause I made a stupid mistake
It can happen to anyone of us
Say you will forgive me

Anyone can fail
Say you will believe me
I can't take
My heart will break

'Cause I made a stupid mistake
A stupid mistake

She was kind of exciting
A little crazy, I should've known
She must have altered my senses
As I offered to walk her home

The situation got out of hand
I hope you understand

It could happen to anyone of us
Anyone you think of
Anyone can fall
Anyone can hurt someone they love

Hearts will break
'cause I made a stupid mistake
It can happen to anyone of us
Say you will forgive me

Anyone can fail
Say you will believe me
I can't take
My heart will break

'Cause I made a stupid mistake
A stupid mistake

A stupid mistake
She means nothin' to me
Nothin' to me
I swear every word is true
Don't want to lose you

The situation got out of hand
I hope you understand

It could happen to anyone of us
Anyone you think of
Anyone can fall
Anyone can hurt someone they love

Hearts will break
'Cause I made a stupid mistake
It can happen to anyone of us
Say you will forgive me

Anyone can fail
Say you will believe me
I can't take
My heart will break
'Cause I made a stupid mistake

It could happen to anyone of us
Anyone you think of
Anyone can fall
Anyone can hurt someone they love
