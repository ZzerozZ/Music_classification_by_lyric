                        I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
 I'mma put it down, you can fall in love

 I'mma put it, I'mma put it, I'mma put it
 I'mma put it down If you put it down right like the way I want it
 Play your cards right, maybe we can fall in love
 If you put it, put it, if you put it down
 If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
 I'mma put it down, you can fall in love If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
 I'mma put it down, you can fall in love If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love Oh way too talk game, it's so tough
 Damn I love it all
 Even the way you flex
 That's what turn me on
 Ooh you know you make me weak
 Just 'cause the way you are
 'Cause everybody in it know you're a star
 But still I'm letting you know
 I got the sweetest heart
 Any man that wants it babe
 He gon' have to work hard
 From what I see, you got what I want
 That's just half the part
 Gotta see what you put on it
 To make sure you're the one If you put it down right like the way I want it
 Play your cards right, maybe we can fall in love
 If you put it, put it, if you put it down
 If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
 I'mma put it down, you can fall in love If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
 I'mma put it down, you can fall in love If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love I hope the chivalry ain't dead to you boy cause I'm grown
 Gotta pull up, and then come up with that when I see what I want
 Gotta go old school women sometimes
 Still keep it soul, twenty twelve for me
 But I still beef it up
 And that I still I want you to know
 Got the sweetest heart
 And even though he can ride it cool for me
 He gon' have to work hard
 And now I see, you got what I want
 That's just half the part
 I gotta feel what you put on it
 To make sure you're the one If you put it down right like the way I want it
 Play your cards right, maybe we can fall in love
 If you put it, put it, if you put it down
 If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
 I'mma put it down, you can fall in love If you put it down right, maybe we can fall in love I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
 I'mma put it down, you can fall in love If you put it down right, maybe we can fall in love Ain't nobody put it down like me though
 Why are you playing? girl you know
 With all this money, and all your cake
 Girl you better stop, I got a big ego
 I'm sipping on that brandy
 That liquor comes in handy
 And girl I know you fancy
 But this party I'm financing
 It's so me, it ain't even like that
 The way you hating all night
 A friend uptight, all right
 (So put it down)
 I took her at the club
 Told the girl she'd be right back
 Back to the crib
 And in the morning all this is worth it
 Baby go get your hair did
 And buy you a couple purses You, you, you, can be the one I go
 When having a bad day
 And I need a shoulder to cry
 You, you, you, might change the way I feel
 Teach me how to let the guard down
 Ain't gone lie, there's been times
 Thought the one I had
 Was the answer to my prayers
 Come to find out and he wasn't the truth
 And I got you, tryna tell me
 If I let you put it down I'mma put it down, you can fall in love If you put it down right like the way I want it
 Play it 'cause we, maybe we can fall in love
 If you put it, put it, put it, if you put it, put it
 If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
 I'mma put it down, you can fall in love If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
 I'mma put it down, you can fall in love If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love If you put it down right like the way I want it If you put it, put it, put it, if you put it, put it down
 If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love
