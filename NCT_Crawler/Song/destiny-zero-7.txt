                        I lie awake, I've gone to ground
 I'm watchin' porn
 In my hotel dressing gown
 Now I dream of you but I still believe
 There's only enough for one in this lonely hotel suite The journey's long and it feels so bad
 I'm thinkin' back to the last day we had
 Old moon fades into the new
 Soon I know I'll be back with you
 I'm nearly with you, I'm nearly with you When I'm weak, I draw strength from you
 And when you're lost, I know how to change your mood
 And when I'm down, you breathe life over me
 Even though we're miles apart, we are each other's destiny On a clear day, I'll fly home to you
 I'm bendin' time and I'm gettin' back to you
 Old moon fades into the new
 Soon I know I'll be back with you
 I'm nearly with you, I'm nearly with you When I'm weak, I draw strength from you
 And when you're lost, I know how to change your mood
 And when I'm down, you breathe life over me
 Even though we're miles apart, we are each other's destiny When I'm weak, I draw strength from you
 And when you're lost, I know how to change your mood
 And when I'm down, you breathe life over me
 Even though we're miles apart, we are each other's destiny I'll fly, I'll fly home
 I'll fly home and I'll fly home
