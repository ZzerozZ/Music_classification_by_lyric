                        Love's fever comin' on strong
 I don't want the fire without the flame, no
 Mother Nature gave me two hands to hold you
 I'm not talkin' pressures or material gains But M O N E Y never did a thing for L O V I N
 I'll never understand what people's heads are in
 Ask me what I need I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
 I need your lovin' or just a little time
 I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
 I need your lovin' or just a little time, this will do Just a little lovin', this will do
 Just a little lovin' this will do
 Just a little lovin' this will do
 Just a little lovin', me and you Love's comin', so glad you're mine
 I don't want your rhythm without your rhyme, no
 Easy feelin', your love keeps getting better
 Say you'll leave me never and together we'll fly 'Cause M O N E Y never did a thing for L O V I N
 I feel it in my bones that you and I can win
 Ask me what I need I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
 I need your lovin' or just a little time
 I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
 I need your lovin' or just a little time, this will do Just a little lovin' this will do
 Just a little lovin' this will do
 Just a little lovin' this will do
 Just a little lovin', me and you L O V I N, I need your lovin
 Just a little lovin', this will do
 L O V I N, I need your lovin
 Just a little lovin', this will do 'Cause M O N E Y never did a thing for L O V I N
 I feel it in my third eye, love will never end, oh
 Ask me what I need I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
 I need your lovin' or just a little time
 I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
 I need your lovin' or just a little time I need your lovin', yeah
 I need your lovin' or just a little time
 I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
 I need your lovin' or just a little time, this will do Just a little lovin', this will do
 Just a little lovin', me and you
 Just a little lovin', this will do
 Just a little lovin', me and you L O V I N, I need your lovin
 Just a little lovin', this will do
 L O V I N, I need your lovin
 Just a little lovin', this will do I need your lovin, I need your lovin
 Just a little lovin', this will do
 Just a little lovin', this will do
 Just a little lovin', me and you L O V I N, my baby love me
 And I love my baby back
 Is there enough love?
