                        Bài hát: Lie To Me - Mikolas Josef

Oh oh she a good girl at home but 
Her skirt goes up like Marilyn Monroe's 
Papa likes the drama mama hotter then lava 
She rocking high heels Prada her face like Madonna 
By the way she moved got me making a puddle
Baby I already knew you would be nothing but a trouble
Damn it everybody knows she never loved for real 
Honey bunny up all night wannabe couplegoals queen 

I know you 'bop-whop-a-lu bop' on his wood bamboo 
When you were still seeing me and well he didn't even knew hmm 
But God damn it come and count to three now sit down GGY 
I'm on fire 

Come and lie to me 
Lie to me oh baby come a little closer 
Lie to me 
Lie to me oh baby lean upon my shoulder 
Lie to me 
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be 
Now you love somebody new I always knew 
So come and give it to me 

When the beat dropped she dropped, dropped it like it's hot 
And now without a second thought she got me doing what I'm not 
Then it got heavy Mom I'm feeling home already 
But steady plenty these greedies wanna eat my spaghetti 
Then she got one of my friends 
She got him dripping on wood 
I know it hurt so bad but it feels so good 
Quit sweet talking me now baby I don't give a damn 
You should've thought about me back when I was your man

I know you 'bop-whop-a-lu bop' on his wood bamboo 
When you were still seeing me and well he didn't even knew hmm 
But God damn it come and count to three now sit down GGY 
I'm on fire 
Come and lie to me Lie to me oh baby come a little closer 
Lie to me 
Lie to me oh baby lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me 
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be 
Now you love somebody new I always knew 
So come and give it to me 

You know I like it 
When you lie lie lie 
You look so good 
When you lie lie lie 
Set my camel in the mood 
When you lie 
When you lie 

Come and lie to me 
Lie to me oh baby come a little closer 
Lie to me 
Lie to me oh baby lean upon my shoulder 
Lie to me 
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be 
Now you love somebody new I always knew 
So come and give it to me
