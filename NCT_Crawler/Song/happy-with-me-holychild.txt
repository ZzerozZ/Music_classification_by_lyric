                        I can't wait
 [I'll ?] see me running around the corner move me up into the upswing
 Call me undone
 When I speak about the truth I'm only brought up to the downbeat

 It's not easy there
 When you feel the wear
 Patience brings the [chair?]
 (oh oh oh)

 Everyday do you notice that we're never free
 Oh, why can't you be happy with me
 Everyday we are running around trapped in our seat
 Oh, why can't you be happy with me
 Oh, why can't you be happy with me

 Pushing paper
 I do everything I'm told, and yet I do it for the money
 Understating
 Every action that I take until I know there's something coming

 It's not easy there
 When you feel the wear
 Patience brings the [chair?]
 (oh oh oh)

 Everyday do you notice that we're never free
 Oh, why can't you be happy with me
 Everyday we are running around trapped in our seat
 Oh, why can't you be happy with me
 Oh, why can't you be happy with me

 The messages won't stop, they just keep pulling at you
 Teasing us with the thought that that is something we'll do
 If we could hold the tongue and focus all our time through
 We would just rise above this cycle that we're bound to

 Everyday do you notice that we're never free
 Oh, why can't you be happy with me
 Everyday we are running around trapped in our seat
 Oh, why can't you be happy with me
 Oh, why can't you be happy with me
 Oh, why can't you be happy with me
