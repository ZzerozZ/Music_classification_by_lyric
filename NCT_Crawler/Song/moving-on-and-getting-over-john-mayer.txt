                        Bài hát: Moving On And Getting Over - John Mayer

Moving on and getting over
Are not the same, it seems to me
Cause you've been gone, I'm growing older
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time

Moving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to be
It's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the time

Tell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
Tell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
For all my running, I can understand
I'm one text away from being back again
But I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm-a getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get over

Moving on and getting over
It's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I sure would like to see you one more time, one more time, baby

It's taken me so long just to say "so long"
Maybe it's all wrong, but I'm moving on
I'm gonna get a new girl, it's something I can do, girl
To try to get me through, girl
Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
Consider me as good as gone
Cause I'm moving on
                        
                    |
