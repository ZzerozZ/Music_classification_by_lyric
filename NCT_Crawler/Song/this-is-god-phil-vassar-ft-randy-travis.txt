                        Song: This Is God - Phil Vassar, Randy Travis

Hey, this is God
 Could I please have your attention
 There's a need for intervention
 Man, I'm disappointed in what I'm seeing Yeah, this is God
 You fight each other in my name
 Treat life like it's a foolish game
 I'd say you've got the wrong idea Oh, all I'm asking for is love
 Well, I've seen you hurt yourselves enough
 Oh, I've been waiting on a change in you Yeah, this is God
 I've given everything to you
 But look at what you do
 To the world that I created This is God
 And what's with this attitude and hate
 You grow more ignorant with age
 You had it made, now look at all you've wasted Oh, all I'm asking for is love
 I've seen you hurt yourselves enough
 Oh, I've been waiting on a change in you, yeah I know your every thought
 Your heart and soul and every move
 There are so many consequences
 To the things you do All I'm asking for is love
 Haven't you hurt yourselves enough
 Oh, I've been waiting on a change in you
 A change in you, oh
 This is God
