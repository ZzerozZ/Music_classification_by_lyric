                        Song: Heroes (We Could Be) - Alesso, Tove Lo

We go hideaway in daylight
We go undercover when under sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty
That’s where we run

Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can’t be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be

Anybody’s got the power
They don’t see it
‘Cos they don’t understand
Spin around and run for hours
You and me we got the world in our hands

Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can’t be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
                        
                    |
