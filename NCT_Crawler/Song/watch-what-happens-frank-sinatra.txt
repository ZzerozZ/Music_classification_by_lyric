                        Let someone start believing in you, let him hold out his hand
 Let him touch you and watch what happens
 One someone who can look in your eyes, and see into your heart
 Let him find you and watch what happens Cold, no I won't believe your heart is cold
 Maybe just afraid to be broken again
 Let someone with a deep love to give
 Give that deep love to you, and what magic you'll see Let someone with a deep love to give
 Give that deep love to you. and what magic you'll see
 Let someone give his heart, someone who cares like me
 Let someone give his heart who cares like me
