                        Bài hát: Hold On Tight - R3hab, Conor Maynard

Where ever I go I am ready
'Cause I know you been through the worst
I know it's dark, but don't you worry
If I know love, it shouldn't hurt

[Chorus]
Hold on tight in the waves with me now
When the lights go, the lights go down
You'll be safe, you'll be sound
Hold on tight, would you wave with me now?
When the night come, the night come
I'll keep you safe, keep you sound
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
Hold on tight

[Verse 2]
We are strong, we are steady
We won't fall in the rain
I hold your head when you're hurting
We all love, but we're scared of faith

[Chorus]
Hold on tight in the waves with me now
When the lights go, the lights go down
You'll be safe, you'll be sound
Hold on tight, would you wave with me now?
When the night come, the night come
I'll keep you safe, keep you sound
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
Hold on tight

Hold on tight in the waves with me now
When the lights go, the lights go down
You'll be safe, you'll be sound
Hold on tight, would you wave with me now?
When the night come, the night come
I'll keep you safe, keep you sound
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
                        
                    |
