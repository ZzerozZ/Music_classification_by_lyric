                        I'm tearing away
 Pieces are falling, I can't seem to make them stay
 You run away
 Faster and faster you can't seem to get away
 Break Hope there's a reason
 For questions unanswered I just don't see everything
 Yes I'm inside you
 Tell me how does it feel to feel like this
 Just like I do I don't care about anyone else but me
 I don't care about anyone
 I don't care about anyone else but me
 I don't care about anyone Do I really want this?
 Sometimes I scare myself I just can't let you go
 Can you believe it?
 Everything happens for reasons I just don't know I don't care about anyone else but me
 I don't care about anyone
 I don't care about anyone else but me
 I don't care about anyone or anything but me
 God damn I love me I don't care about anyone else but me
 I don't care about anyone
 I don't care about anyone else but me
 I don't care about anyone I don't care about anyone else but me
 I don't care about anyone
 I don't care about anyone else but me
 I don't care about anyone
