                        Butterflies is what I feel inside
 And every time it's like my first time oo wee
 And I can never find the words to say
 You're the perfect girl
 you're made for me
 It's so easy to love you baby
 We're compatible, incredible and natural we are
 And girl I've never felt this way before
 From the bottom of my heart
 Baby girl I just wanna tell you that you are The reason I love the reason I trust
 God sent me an angel
 You are the best in the world
 A wonderful girl
 Knowing you're by my side brings tears to my eyes baby
 Girl you had me from the moment I looked into your eyes
 And I knew you were an angel but you were in disguise
 Tell me how can I be so lucky
 that you'll fall down from heaven for me
 oo baby Some people search a life time and never find a true love oo wee
 Heaven care enough for me to give me you
 And now our hearts can beat together
 Standing strong girl here forever
 You and I(you and I)
 You and I (you and I)
 I just want you to know that you're The reason I love the reason I trust
 God sent me an angel
 You are the best in the world
 A wonderful girl
 Knowing you by my side and a man ain't supposed to cry But girl you are
 the only woman I'll make love to
 You are
 The reason I come home every night
 girl you are
 You're all that I need in my life
 It almost feel
