                        Baby, seasons change but people don't
 And I'll always be waiting in the back room
 I'm boring but overcompensate
 With headlines and flash, flash, flash photography But don't pretend you'll ever forget 'bout me
 Don't pretend you'll ever forget 'bout me Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
 Style your wake for fashion magazines
 Widow or a divorcee?
 Don't pretend, d-d-d-don't pretend We don't fight fair
 We don't fight fair They say your head can be a prison
 Then these are just conjugal visits
 People will dissect us
 Til this doesn't mean a thing anymore Don't pretend you'll ever forget 'bout me
 Don't pretend you'll ever forget 'bout me Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
 Style your wake for fashion magazines
 Widow or a divorcee?
 Don't pretend, d-d-d-don't pretend We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
 We're dropped and well concealed in secret places, whoa
 We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
 We're dropped and well concealed in secret places We don't fight fair
 We don't fight fair
 We don't fight fair
 We don't fight fair
 We don't fight fair We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
 We're dropped and well concealed in secret places, whoa
 We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
 We're dropped and well concealed in secret places We don't fight fair
 With smiles on our faces
 We're dropped and well concealed in secret places
 We don't fight fair Don't pretend you'll ever do forget 'bout me
 We don't fight fair
 Don't pretend you'll ever forget 'bout me
 We don't fight fair
