Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Getting closer to the final frontier
We've reached the point of no return
The beast is hungry, it wants more

Everyday I see it everywhere
The hatred senseless violence
Consuming our precious souls

There's no more sense in anything
Humanity's limping to it's grave

[Chorus:]
What if everything would change
And we would build a better world?
Would you call that utopia?
Would you call that Paradise?
Yes, the answer lies in questions
That are simple but so true
What would you do... 
If it's your last night on Earth?
                        
                    |
