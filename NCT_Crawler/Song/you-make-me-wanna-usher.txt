                        this is what you do 
this is what you do 
this is what you do 

[Chorus] 
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with 
start a new relationship with you 
this is what you do 
think about her and the things that come along with 
you make me 
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with 
start a new realtionship with you 
this is what you do 
think about her and the things that come along with 
you make me 
you make me 

[Verse1] 

Before anything came between us 
You were like my bestfriend 
The one I used to run to when me and my 
girl was having problems (thats right) 
You used to say it would be okay 
suggest little nice things I should do 
And when I come home at night and lay my head down 
all I seem to think about is you 
And how you make me wanna 

[Chorus] 
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with 
start a new relationship with you 
this is what you do 
think about her and the things that come along with 
you make me 
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with 
start a new realtionship with you 
this is what you do 
think about her and the things that come along with 
you make me 
you make me 

[Verse2] 

Now what's bad 
Is your're the one that hooked us up 
Knowing it should've been you 
What's sad is I love her but I'm falling for you 
What should I do 
Should I 
Tell my baby bye-bye 
Should I 
Do exactly what I feel inside 
Cause I 
I don't wanna go 
Don't need to stay 
But I really need to get it together 

[Chorus] 
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with (oh baby) 
start a new relationship with you 
this is what you do 
think about her and the things that come along with 
you make me 
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with (oh baby) 
start a new relationship with you 
this is what you do 
think about her and the things that come along with 
you make me 
you make me 

[Verse 3] 

At this point 
The situation's out of control 
I never meant to hurt her but I 
Gotta let her go 
And if she may not understand it 
Why all of this is going on 
I tried 
I tried to fight it but the feelings just too strong 

You make me wanna wanna 
You make me wanna 

[Chorus] 
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with 
start a new relationship with you 
this is what you do 
think about her and the things that come along with 
you make me 
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with 
start a new relationship with you 
this is what you do 
think about her and the things that come along with 
you make me 
you make me
