                        Songs of pain and soothing lullabies,
Songs of happiness and some that make us cry.
One song we share,
The cross we all bear,
One that segregates,
One that unifies.

All we wonder,
No-one ever denies,
If once given life we must die.

So bow down with me,
Where summer fades into fall,
And leave your hatchets of hate.
Bow down with me,
And sing the saddest of all,
The song we all serenade.

The more we know,
The less we understand,
Life, eternity, the savagery of man.
We want it all,
Aimed at the fall,
What is destiny within the masterplan?

All we wonder,
No-one ever denies,
If once given life we must die.

So bow down with me,
Where summer fades into fall,
And leave your hatchets of hate.
Bow down with me,
And sing the saddest of all,
The song we all serenade.

Hold on now,
Don’t leave, don’t let it go.
Dance away the waltz of life.
Right or wrong,
The seed we never sow -
That’s our loss, our sacrifice.

What does the winter bring,
If not yet another spring?

Bow down with me,
Where summer fades into fall,
And leave your hatchets of hate.
Bow down with me,
And sing the saddest of all,
The song we all serenade.
