                        Who's the loving daddy with the beautiful eyes
 What a pair o' shoes, I'd like to try 'em for size
 I'll just tell him, "Baby, won't you swing it with me"
 Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
 So, I said politely "Darling may I intrude"
 He said "Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood" First I held him lightly and we started to dance
 Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance
 And I said "Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
 There's a mess of moonlight, won't you share it with me"
 "Well" he answered "Baby, don't you know that it's rude
 To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood" In the mood, that's what he told me
 In the mood, and when he told me
 In the mood, my heart was skipping
 It didn't take me long to say "I'm in the mood now" In the mood for all his kissing
 In the mood his crazy loving
 In the mood what I was missing
 It didn't take me long to say "I'm in the mood now" So, I said politely "Darling may I intrude"
 He said "Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood" "Well" he answered "Baby, don't you know that it's rude
 To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood" Who's the loving daddy with the beautiful eyes
 What a pair o' shoes, I'd like to try 'em for size
 I'll just tell him, "Baby, won't you swing it with me"
 Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
 So, I said politely "Darling may I intrude"
 He said "Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood" First I held him lightly and we started to dance
 Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance
 And I said "Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three

 "Well" he answered "Baby, don't you know that it's rude
 To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood"
