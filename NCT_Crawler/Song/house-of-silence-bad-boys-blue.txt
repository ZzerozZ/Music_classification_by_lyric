                        In my dreams I met a girl
 Somewhere down the river
 She took me to an ancient house
 She looked young but also wise
 Something made me shiver
 She was both dead and alive
 And I could see the ravens fly
 In the house of silence far from here
 Distant voices coming out of the air
 The house of silence sends our tears
 Shadows dancing for a hundred years
 And they cry
 (Girl: Give me your love)
 I saw her sleep but couldn't hear
 What the girl was saying
 And sadness filled the misty night
 Then I tried to hold her back
 While she was slowly fading
 Bittersweet was her smile
 And I could see the ravens fly
 In the house of silence far from here
 Distant voices coming out of the air
 The house of silence sends our tears
 Shadows dancing for a hundred years
 And they cry
 (Girl: Give me your love)
 (Girl: Give me your love)
 In the house of silence far from here
 Distant voices coming out of the air
 The house of silence sends our tears
 Shadows dancing for a hundred years
 In the house of silence far from here
 Distant voices coming out of the air
 The house of silence sends our tears...
