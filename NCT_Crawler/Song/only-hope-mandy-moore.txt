                        There's a song that's inside of my soul
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again.
I'm awaken in the infinite cold
But you sing to me over and over and over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours
I pray
To be only yours
I know now
You're my only hope

Sing to me the song of the stars
Of your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again
When it feels like my dreams are so far
Sing to me all the plans that you have for me over again.

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours
I pray
To be only yours
I know now
You're my only hope

I give you my destiny
I'm giving you all of me
I want your symphony
Singing in all that I am
At the top of my lungs
I'm giving it back

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours
I pray
To be only yours
I pray
To be only yours
I know now
You're my only hope

Mmm....
Ooh....
