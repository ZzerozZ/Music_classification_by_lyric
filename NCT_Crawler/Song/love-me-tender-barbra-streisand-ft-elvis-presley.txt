                        Bài hát : Love Me Tender - Barbra Streisand, Elvis Presley

Wasn't it just yesterday
when you held me near
Whispering the sweetest words
that I longed to head
Love me tender,
love me sweet,
never let me go
You have made my life complete
and I love you so
Love me tender,
love me true,
all my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
and I always will
Love me tender
(Love me tender)
love me long
take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong,
and we'll never part
Love me tender,
love me true
all my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
and I always will
Love me tender,
love me true
tell me you are mine

I'll be yours through all the years
till the end of time
Love me tender,
love me true
all my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
(I love you)
and I always will
and I always will
                        
                    |
