                        Song: Lonely Eyes - Chris Young
Tuesday night crowded bar
 Some guy lights a cheap cigar
 Bartender yells at him
 So he walks out and you walk in
 Right through that cloud of smoke
 Catcalls and dirty jokes
 Scan the room a couple times
 Find a seat right next to mine Lonely eyes
 Well, it sure looks like
 You just might
 Be looking for something
 For something, whoa
 Look at me
 And I think you'll see
 Those lonely eyes
 Don't have to be alone tonight They analyze your glass of wine
 Roll away a pickup line
 Now and then they check your phone
 Catch mine and let 'em go
 From the little bit I've seen
 They're the perfect shade of green
 Next time they come my way,
 Heaven help me, make 'em stay Lonely eyes
 Well, it sure looks like
 You just might
 Be looking for something
 For something, whoa
 Look at me
 And I think you'll see
 Those lonely eyes
 Don't have to be alone tonight Don't make me pay my tab, catch a cab
 Go home and kick myself to sleep tonight
 Gimme a sign, just a smile
 Baby, I'll be glad to lose myself deep inside
 Lonely eyes Lonely eyes
 Sure looks like
 You just might
 Be looking for something
 For something, whoa
 Look at me
 And I think you'll see
 Those lonely eyes
 They don't have to be alone tonight Lonely eyes, you don't have to be alone tonight
