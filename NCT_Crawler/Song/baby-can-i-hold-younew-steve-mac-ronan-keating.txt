                        Bài hát: Baby Can I Hold You(New Steve Mac) - Ronan Keating

"I'm sorry," 
It's all that you can say 
Years gone by and still 
Words don't come easily 
Like "sorry" (like "sorry"..like "sorry"..) 
"Forgive me," 
is all that you can say 
Years gone by and still 
Words don't come easily 
Like "forgive me" ("forgive me"..."forgive me"..) 
Forgive me.. 

But you can say, baby 
Baby can I hold you tonight? 
Baby, if I told you the right words 
oooh, at the right time 
You'll be mine 

I love you 
is all that you can say 
Years gone by and still 
Words don't come easily (words don't come easily..) 
Like "I love you", I love you.. 

But you can say, baby 
Baby can I hold you tonight? 
Baby, if I told you the right words 
oooh, at the right time 
You'll be mine 

(Baby can I hold you...) 
But you can say, baby 
Baby can I hold you tonight? 
Baby, if I told you the right words 
oooh, at the right time 
You'll be mine 

(Baby, if I hold you..) 
(Baby, can I hold you..) You'll be mine.. 
(Baby if I told you..) 
(Baby, can I hold you..) 
You'll be mine.. 
(Baby if I told you..) 
Baby, can I hold you
