                        Bài hát: Take A Hint - Nightcore

Why am I always hit on by the boys I never like
I can always see ‘em coming 
From the left and from the right
I don't want to be a priss 
I just try to be polite
But it always seems to bite me in the.

Ask me for my number, yeah you put me on the spot
You think that we should hook-up 
But I think that we should not
You had me at hello, then you opened up your mouth
And that is when it started going south
Oh.

Get your hands off my hips 
‘fore i'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my— Hey
Take a hint, take a hint
No you can't buy me a drink
Let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
La, La, La....
T-take a hint, take a hint
La, La, La.

I guess you still don't get it 
So let's take it from the top
You asked me what my sign is 
And I told you it was Stop
And if I only had a dime 
For every name that you just dropped
You'd be here and I'd be on a yacht
Oh.

Get your hands off my hips 
Or i'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my— Hey
Take a hint, take a hint
No you can't buy me a drink 
Let me tell you what I think
Take A Hint (Nightcore) lyrics on ***
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
La, La, La
T-take a hint, take a hint
La, La, La.

What about “no” don't you get
So go and tell your friends
I'm not really interested
It's about time that you're leavin'
I'm gonna count to three and
Open my eyes and
You'll be gone.

One
Get your hands off my
Two
Or i'll punch you in the
Three
Stop your staring at my 
Hey
Take a hint, take a hint
I am not your missing link
Let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint.
