I don't need a rich boy
I don't want your money
No, you don't gotta spend nothing on me
All I want is sweet sweet love, sweet sweet love
Hey!
I don't need a rich boy
I don't want dollars
No you don't gotta be a high roller
All I want is sweet sweet love, sweet sweet love
Hey!

Hey!
Hey!
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
All I want
Sweet sweet love
Hey!
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
All I want
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
Hey!

I don't need a rich boy
I don't want your money
No you don't gotta spend nothing on me
All I want is sweet sweet love
I don't need a rich boy
I don't want dollars
No you don't gotta be a high roller
All I want is sweet sweet love, sweet sweet love
Hey!

I don't need a rich boy
I don't want your money
No you don't gotta spend nothing on me
All I want is sweet sweet love
Hey!
I don't need a rich boy
I don't want dollars
No you don't gotta be a high roller
All I want is sweet sweet love, sweet sweet love
