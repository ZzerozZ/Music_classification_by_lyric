MAMA

She used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day I crossed the line
I didn't mean to be so bad (harmony)
I never thought you would become the friend I never had
Back then I didn't know why
why you were misunderstood (Mama)
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love
Mama I love you
Mama I care
Mama I love you
Mama my friend
You're my friend

Mama I love you.....
I didn't want to hear it then but
I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I had a lot of time to think about
about the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility
but now I'm sure I know why (I know why)
why you were misunderstood
So now Isee through your eyes
all I can give you is love (all I can give you is love)
