                        Bài hát: You Are So Beautiful - Russell Watson

You are so beautiful to me 
You are so beautiful to me 
Can't you see? You're everything I hoped for 
You're everything I need 
You are so beautiful to me You are so beautiful to me 
You are so beautiful, baby, to me 
Can't you see? You're everything I hoped for 
You're everything I need 
You are so beautiful to me Oh, can't you see?
