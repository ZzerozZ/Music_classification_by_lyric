Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence 
One step from lashing out at you
You want in to get under my skin 
And call yourself a friend 
I've got more friends like you 
What do I do?

Is there no standard anymore? 
What it takes, who I am, where I've been 
Belong 
You can't be something you're not 
Be yourself, by yourself 
Stay away from me 
A lesson learned in life 
Known from the dawn of time

[Chorus]
Respect, walk

Run your mouth when I'm not around 
It's easy to achieve 
You cry to weak friends that sympathize 

Can you hear the violins playing your song? 
Those same friends tell me your every word

Is there no standard anymore? 
What it takes, who I am, where I've been 
Belong 
You can't be something you're not 
Be yourself, by yourself 
Stay away from me 
A lesson learned in life 
Known from the dawn of time

[Chorus]

Are you talking to me? 
No way punk
Walk on home boy
                        
                    |
