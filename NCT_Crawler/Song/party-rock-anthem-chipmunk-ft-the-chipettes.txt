                        Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
We just wanna see ya shake that

In the club party rock, lookin' for your girl? She on my jock
Nonstop when we in the spot, booty movin' weight like she on the block
Where the drank? I gots to know, tight jeans, tattoo 'cause I'm rock 'n' roll
Half black, half white, domino, game the money, op-a-doe

Yo, I'm runnin' through these ho's like Drano
I got that devilish flow, rock 'n' roll, no halo
We party rock, yeah, that's the crew that I'm reppin'
On the rise to the top, no lead in our zeppelin, hey

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
We just wanna see ya shake that

Everyday I'm shufflin'
Shufflin', shufflin'



One more shot for us, another round
Please fill up my cup, don't mess around
We just wanna see you shake it now
Now you wanna be, you're naked now

Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Put your hands up to the sound, put your hands up to the sound

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, put your hands up to the sound, to the sound
Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up

Party rock is in the house tonight
(Put your hands up)
Everybody just have a good time
(Put your hands up)
And we gonna make you lose your mind
(Put your hands up)
Everybody just have a good, good, good time

Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Shake that, everyday I'm shufflin'
