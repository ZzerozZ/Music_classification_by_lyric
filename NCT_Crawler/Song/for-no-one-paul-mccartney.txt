                        The day breaks, your mind aches
 You find that all her words of kindness linger on
 When she no longer needs you She wakes up, she makes up
 She takes her time
 And doesn't feel she has to hurry
 She no longer needs you And in her eyes you see nothing
 No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
 A love that should have lasted years You want her, you need her
 And yet you don't believe her
 When she says her love is dead
 You think she needs you And in her eyes you see nothing
 No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
 A love that should have lasted years You stay home, she goes out
 She says that long ago she knew someone
 But now he's gone
 She doesn't need him Your day breaks, your mind aches
 There will be times when all the things she said
 Will fill your head
 You won't forget her And in her eyes you see nothing
 No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
 A love that should have lasted years
                        
                    |
