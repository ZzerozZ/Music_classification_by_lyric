                        If ever words were spoken 
Painful and untrue 
I said I loved but I lied 
In my life 
All I wanted 
Was the keeping 
Of someone like you 
As it turns out 
Deeper within me 
Love was twisted and pointed at you

Never ending pain, quickly ending life

[Chorus]
You keep this love, thing, child, toy 
You keep this love, fist, scar, break 
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one 
Stole her from herself 
This gift in pain 
Her pain was life 
And sometimes I feel so sorry 
I regret this the hurting of you 
But you make me so unhappy 
I'd take my life and leave love with you

I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself 

[Chorus]
                        
                    |
