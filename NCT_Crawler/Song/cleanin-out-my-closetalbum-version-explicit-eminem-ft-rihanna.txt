                        Intro:
 Where's my snare
 I have no snare on my headphones
 There you go
 Yeah
 Yo, yo

 Have you eva been hated, or discriminated against?
 I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
 Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
 Sick is the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
 All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
 Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
 Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
 Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin'
 Leave'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
 See they can trigga me, but they'll neva figure me out
 Look at me now, I betcha probley sick of me now
 Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

 Chorus:
 I'm sorry mama
 I never meant to hurt you
 I never meant to make you cry
 But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

 One more time

 I said
 I'm sorry mama
 I never meant to hurt you
 I never meant to make you cry
 But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
 Ha!

 I got some skeletons in my closet
 And I don't know if no one knows it
 So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
 Imma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
 Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' cd
 I was a baby maybe I was just a coupla months
 My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
 No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
 I look at hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side,
 Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work
 Wit her at least for Hailie's sake
 I maybe made some mistakes
 But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
 What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
 But the smartest *** I did was take the bullets outta that gun
 'Cause I'd of killed 'em, *** I woulda shot Kim and them both
 It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show

 Chorus:
 I'm sorry mama
 I never meant to hurt you
 I never meant to make you cry
 But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

 One more time

 I said I'm sorry mama
 I never meant to hurt you
 I never meant to make you cry
 But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

 Now I would never *** my own mama just to get recognition
 Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is ***in
 But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
 Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
 Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and ***'s missin'
 Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
 My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
 'Til I grew up, now I grew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't't't it?
 Wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me, ma!
 So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma!
 But guess what, ya gettin' olda now and it's cold when yaw lonely
 And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
 And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
 But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
 See whets hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
 Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yaself that you was a mom
 But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get,
 You selfish bitch
 I hope you fuckin' burn in in hell for this ***
 Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
 Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

 Chorus:
 I'm sorry mama
 I never meant to hurt you
 I never meant to make you cry
 But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

 One more time

 I said I'm sorry mama
 I never meant to hurt you
 I never meant to make you cry
 But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
