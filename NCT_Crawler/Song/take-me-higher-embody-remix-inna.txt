                        Bài hát: Take Me Higher (Embody Remix) - Inna

Do you remember that summer we had it all 
We spent our days in the ocean, under the sun 
And when the night time was over 
We'd just begun 
You don't know what's forgotten until it's gone 
I know that we, we were on in a moment 
How could this be, a woman 
I should be free 
But you know that I want you 
Don't let me dance with myself all night long 

You take me on, take me on, to the ceiling 
Higher with every touch 
You turn me, turn me on, can you feel it? 
I wanna be in love 

Do you remember that summer we had it all 
We spent our days in the ocean, under the sun 
And when the night time was over 
We'd just begun 
You don't know what's forgotten until it's gone 
I know that we, we were on in a moment 
How could this be, a woman 
I should be free 
But you know that I want you 
Don't let me dance with myself all night long 

You take me on, take me on, to the ceiling 
Higher with every touch 
You turn me, turn me on, can you feel it? 
I wanna be in love 

Take me higher 
Hi-hi-higher, hi-hi-higher
