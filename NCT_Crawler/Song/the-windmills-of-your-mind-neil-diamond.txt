                        Round like a circle in a spiral
 Like a wheel within a wheel
 Never ending on beginning
 On an ever-spinning reel
 Like a snowball down a mountain
 Or a carnival balloon
 Like a carousel that's turning
 Running rings around the moon
 Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
 Past the minutes on its face
 And the world is like an apple
 Whirling silently in space
 Like the circles that you find
 In the windmills of your mind

 Like a tunnel that you follow
 To a tunnel of its own
 Down a hollow to a cavern
 Where the sun has never shone
 Like a door that keeps revolving
 In a half-forgotten dream
 Or the ripples from a pebble
 Someone tosses in a stream
 Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
 Past the minutes on its face
 And the world is like an apple
 Whirling silently in space
 Like the circles that you find
 In the windmills of your mind

 Keys that jingle in your pocket
 Words that jangle in your head
 Why did summer go so quickly?
 Was it something that I said?
 Lovers walk along a shore
 And leave their footprints in the sand
 Was the sound of distant drumming
 Just the fingers of your hand?
 Pictures hanging in a hallway
 Or the fragment of a song
 Half-remembered names and faces
 But to whom do they belong?
 When you knew that it was over
 Were you suddenly aware
 That the autumn leaves were turning
 To the color of her hair?

 Like a circle in a spiral
 Like a wheel within a wheel
 Never ending or beginning
 On an ever-spinning reel
 As the images unwind
 Like the circles that you find
 In the windmills of your mind
                        
                    |
