 Too late for the other side
 Caught in a chase, 25 to life

 [Verse 1]
 I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
 Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
 But I've already wasted over half my life
 I woulda laid down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
 No more pain, bitch, you took me for granted, took my heart and ran it
 Straight into the planet, into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
 Now my respect I demand it: I'mma take control of this relationship
 Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now, goddammit
 And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
 So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
 I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
 Faithful all the way, this is how I *** get repaid?
 Look at how I dress: *** baggy sweats, go to work a mess
 Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
 Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
 I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
 And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
 But you keep treating me like a staircase, it's time to *** step
 And I won't be coming back, so don't hold your *** breath
 You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
 I told you you'd be sorry if I *** left, I laughed while you wept
 How's it feel now, yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
 Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
 But a special place for you in my heart I have kept, it's unfortunate but it's

 [Verse 2]
 I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
 Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
 'til I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
 How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that
 Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you
 Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still, man
 I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
 I'm divorcing you: go marry someone else and make 'em famous
 And take away their freedom like you did to me
 Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
 Feed 'em the same *** that you made me eat, I'm moving on, forget you
 Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
 All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
 Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times it's ridiculous
 And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
 But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
 Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
 My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
 I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to ***
 I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed
 But this time I ain't changing my mind, I'm climbing out this abyss
 You're screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
 But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
 *** you, hip hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served, bitch and it's just...
