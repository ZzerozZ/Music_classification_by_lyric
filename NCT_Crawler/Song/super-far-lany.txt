                        Bài hát: Super Far - Lany

Up all night on my mind got me thinking
Wanna stay, can you give me a reason
I don't think so, I don't think so
I'm in love with someone but I'm not sure
She can love someone back the way they love her
I don't think so, I don't think so

Don't be mean if you wanna go
You can leave and leave my heart alone

Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection
All you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love I don't want it

Give it time, come on babe it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work know it hurts but I'll go there
Do the same can you show me that you care
God I hope so but I don't think so

Don't be mean if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you

Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection
All you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy and you know it and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection
All you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy and you know it and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it
