R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        I said we friendship come first, the band did come second
 And that's why I decided to put it in a song
 So listen crowd of people and throw up unnu hands
 If you love dem their style and you love dem pattern

 [Chorus:]

 Reggae music can't refuse it
 So give us what we want and mek we gwan

 I said yes crowd of people we come back again
 I man thriller E. And all me best best friends
 I know most of dem from age eleven
 And some of dem even before then
 We travel the whole world, think it could never end
 But don't get me wrong it a no big problem
 Cos reggae what we love and that's what we defend
 And that there love that could a never end

 [Chorus:]

 Reggae music can't refuse it
 So give us what we want and mek we gwan.

 So let me get back to the subject of me friends
 Cos me respect and love love the whole of them.
 And that there love that could a never end.
 And now it is time to hail the whole of them
 Me love me mickey V. Him in a category.
 Robin on guitar him just a nice up every bar.
 Me love me astro because him deh pon de go
 Me love me norman cos him a don gorgon

 [Chorus:]

 Reggae music can't refuse it
 So give us what we want and mek we gwan.
