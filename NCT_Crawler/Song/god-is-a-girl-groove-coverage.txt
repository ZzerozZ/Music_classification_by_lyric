Singger: Groove Coverage
Remembering me,discover and see 
All over the world,she's known as a girl 
To those who are free,their minds shall be keep 
Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last 

Chorus : 
God is a girl,wherever you are, 
Do you believe it,can you receive it, 
God is a girl,whatever you say 
Do you believe it,can you receive it, 
God is a girl,however you live, 
Do you believe it,can you receive it, 
God is a girl,she's only a girl 
Do you believe it,can you receive it? 

She wants to shine, forever in time, 
She is so driven, she's always mine, 
Clearly and free,she wants to be, 
A part of the future,a girl like me, 
There is a sky, eliminating us, 
Someone is out there, that we truly trust, 
There is a rainbow,for you and me, 
A beautiful sunrise, eternally. 

Chorus: 
God is a girl,wherever you are, 
Do you believe it,can you receive it, 
God is a girl,whatever you say 
Do you believe it,can you receive it, 
God is a girl,however you live, 
Do you believe it,can you receive it, 
God is a girl,she's only a girl 
Do you believe it,can you receive it?
