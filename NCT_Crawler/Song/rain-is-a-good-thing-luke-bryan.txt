                        [Verse 1] 
My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky 
He'd cuss kick the dust, sayin' son it's way to dry 
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains 
But where I come from, rain is a good thing 

[Chorus] 
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey 
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky 
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck 
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town 
Start washin' all our worries down the drain 
Rain is a good thing 

[Verse 2] 
Ain't nothin' like a kiss out back in the barn 
Ringin' out our soakin' clothes, ridin' out a thunderstorm 
When tin roof gets to talkin'; that's the best love we made 
Yea where I come from, rain is a good thing 

[Repeat Chorus] 

[Bridge] 
Farmer Johnson does a little dance 
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants 
Country girls, they wanna cuddle 
Kids out playin' in a big mud puddle 

[Repeat Chorus] 

Rain is a good thing, rain is a good thing, rain is a good thing
                        
                    |
