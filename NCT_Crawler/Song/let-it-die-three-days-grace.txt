                        We had fire in our eyes
 In the beginning I
 Never felt so alive
 In the beginning you
 You blame me, but
 It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
 I just don't want to hear it anymore I swear, I never meant to let it die
 I just don't care about you anymore
 It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
 I just don't care about you anymore We had time on our side
 In the beginning we
 We had nothing to hide
 In the beginning you
 You blame me, but
 It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
 I just don't want to hear it anymore I swear, I never meant to let it die
 I just don't care about you anymore
 It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
 I just don't care about you anymore You say that I didn't try
 You say that I didn't try
 You say that I didn't try I swear, I never meant to let it die
 I just don't care about you anymore
 It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
 I just don't care about you anymore
 I just don't care about you anymore
 I just don't care about you anymore
 I just don't care about you anymore
 I just don't care about you anymore
