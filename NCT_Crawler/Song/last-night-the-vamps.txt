                        Bài hát : Last Night - The Vamps

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

I hold my hands up high
And throw my glass into the sky.
But when the morning comes,
We'll never see the sun.

And if the walls close in
Then let's just start it all again.
That's when the evening comes
Oh yeah the evening comes.

[Pre-chorus:]
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh
No we're not going home tonight
Wake up the stars are shining
We'll do it all, we'll do it all
We'll do it again.

[Chorus:]
Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
No, my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?
Yeah last night think we were dancing,
Singing all our favorite songs.
Think I might have kissed someone.
And if tomorrow never comes
We had last night.

Let's shut this party down,
And pull the building to the ground,
Yeah girl let's live it up,
One night is all we got.

Let's dance until we die,
Nobody's going home tonight,
This kiss could be our last,
Come on and raise your glass.

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2x:]
We do it all again [2x]
So bring your friends and tell a friend to bring another friend (last night)
We do it all again [2x]
By the end of tonight
We can all be friends
We do it all again [2x]
So bring your friends and tell a friend to bring another friend (last night)
We do it all again [2x]
By the end of tonight

[Chorus 2x]
                        
                    |
