                        She...
She screams in silence
a Sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world
Thats been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use

Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

She...
She's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Wa-king up this time
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world
Thats been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use

Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

YAHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Are you locked up in a world
Thats been planned out for you

Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you
