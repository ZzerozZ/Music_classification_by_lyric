                        Bài hát: Do You Mind - DJ Khaled, Nicki Minaj, Chris Brown, August Alsina, Jeremih, Future, Rick Ross

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, he ain't messin' with no average chick, pop, pop
He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot
Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron-Iguodala blocks
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes
Hittin' them home runs, I be like "Go Mets!"
I want a dude that still kiss me when he mad
Type to cop me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina, Chris Brown & (DJ Khaled)]
Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby you should be up in my bed, ooh
Do you mind, do you mind? Baby you (DJ Khaled)
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?

[Hook: Chris Brown & August Alsina]
I'm just tryna get to know ya
Get a little closer, maybe post up, ooh
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby you should be up in my bed, ooh
Do you mind, do you mind? Baby you

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Oh, do you mind if I talk to you?
And do you mind if I touch you there?
Girl, you know you can't do no better, baby
I know that it don't get no better than me
Let's not waste the time
You ain't gotta hold back cause once I get inside
You won't change your mind, you know that you can take it
No need to hesitate, I need it, impatient
I'm not used to waiting, I want you to give it to me
Come on let me taste it, until I get enough
Hope you're ready cause I'ma beat it up
Do you mind when I'mma have it? Know how to heat it up

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
I should, I should be the one, baby, you gon' learn that
Girl, I know your body, know where every curve at
We be going all night, 'til the early
Know you, know you wanna take off when you on my runway
We ain't gotta talk, bodies conversate
Baby, by the way I touch you, you know what I'm saying
Oh, oh, oh, ride it slow
Oh, oh, oh

[Hook: Chris Brown & August Alsina]

You know, you know, you know, you know

[Verse 4: Future]
Man with all this red carpet ***, baby
You know what I'm saying, Future Hendrix
I'ma do that favor, drippin' flavor in you two piece
I'ma keep my promise, never treat you like a groupie
Calamari dinners, got you eatin' raw sushi
Still in the trap, but I like my bitches bougie
Two cups of styrofoam, excuse me lil' mama
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover
You want watches, new Versaces, you want Céline
Top back, screamin' money ain't a ting

[Verse 5: Rick Ross]
Seein' two G-wagons in my driveway
FaceTime, two black bottles by my fireplace
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now
Took you shoppin' in other places that I won't name
First time your friends really got the see Balmain
20 million cash, seen it there with my two eyes
We the best and I told you this back in '05
(Maybach Music)

Baby you should be up in my bed, ooh
Do you mind, do you mind? Baby you
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Oh, just in case you need me, I don't mind
Yo, tell them what to do, tell them what to do
Tell them what to do
When you see a bad bitch in front of you, baby
Yeah, assume the position

[Hook: Chris Brown & August Alsina]
I'm just tryna get to know ya

Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby you should be up in my bed, ooh
Do you mind, do you mind? Baby you
