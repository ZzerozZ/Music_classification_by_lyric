                        Bài hát: Anywhere I Go - Vicetone

There's a part of me 
That's lying underneath 
That wants to see the darker side 
Nothing I won't try 
Once or maybe twice 
Are you down to take the ride? 

Living so naive, never going deep 
Ain't a pill I could swallow, swallow, yeah 
Taking off the edge, all I'm asking is 
Will you be there to follow? 

So down, hit ground when I'm going low 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow 
Go round, all out when I lose control 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow 

Follow, follow, follow.... 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow 
Follow, follow, follow.... 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow 

Don't wanna put this wrong 
I know I'm coming strong 
But I can't get this off my mind 
Imagine you and me 
Or you and me and she 
Where do you go when you run wild? 

Living so naive, never going deep 
Ain't a pill I could swallow, swallow, yeah 
Taking off the edge, all I'm asking is 
Will you be there to follow? 

So down, hit ground when I'm going low 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow 
Go round, all out when I lose control 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow 

Follow, follow, follow.... 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow 
Follow, follow, follow.... 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow 
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
