                        Bài hát: Anti-Hero - Sekai No Owari

You know I don't give a damn about what's "right"
Or pleasing everyone around me
Cause I know this world that brought us life
Wasn't made to keep everyone happy

The rules and laws and countries come up with
In front of me, they're all *** 
Cause there are people that I've gotta protect
And if you get in my way, you're dead

You see I'm tired of trying to justify
Every decision that I make
If it's to save the people that I stand by

You better believe what I say:
"Stay in the lines, don't make a scene"
Heroes try to tell us what's right
But when push comes to shove, you'll know what I mean
I'm ready to start a fight

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
So I can save you when the time comes

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Yeah

Righteousness is a thing that I hate
Cause it doesn't do any good for anyone
And everyone thinks everything is OK
If they just obey

I don't want to think about what they see
When they look up and see evil me
You see, love isn't what I need
As long as I can set you free

Oh bum bum bum, watch out here I come
I said bum bum bum, you all better run
Oh bum bum bum, watch out here I come
So run!

"Stay in the lines, don't make a scene"
Heroes try to tell us what's right
But when push comes to shove, you'll know what I mean
I'm ready to start a fight

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
So I can save you when the time comes

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Yeah

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
So I can save you when the time comes

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Yeah
