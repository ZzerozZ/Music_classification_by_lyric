                        Bài hát: When You Believe - Leon Jackson

Many nights we’ve prayed,
With no proof anyone could hear.
In our hearts a hopeful song,
We barely understood.

Now we are not afraid,
Although we know there’s much to fear.
We were moving mountains long, 
Before we knew we could.

There can be miracles,
When you believe.
Though hope is frail, 
It’s hard to kill.
Who knows what miracles,
You can achieve.
When you believe,
Some how you will.
You will when you believe.

Easy to despair,
When all you hear is fear and lies.
Easy just to run and hide,
To frightened to begin.

But if we dare to dare,
Don’t wait for answers from the sky.
Each of us can look inside,
And hear this song within.

There can be miracles,
When you believe.
Though hope is frail, 
It’s hard to kill.
Who knows what miracles,
You can achieve.
When you believe,
Some how you will.
You will when you believe.

They don’t always happen when, you ask.
And it’s easy to give in, to your fear.
But when you blinded by your faith,
Can’t see your way clear through the rain,
A small but still resilient voice;
Says hope is very near.
Ohhhhh.

There can be miracles,
When you believe.
Though hope is frail,
It's hard to kill.
Who knows what miracles,
You can achieve.
When you believe,
Some how you will. . .

How you will
You will when you believe.
You will when you believe.
                        
                    |
