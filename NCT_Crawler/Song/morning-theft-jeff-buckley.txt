                        Time takes care of the wound, so I can believe
 You had so much to give, you thought I couldn't see
 Gifts for boot, heels to crush, promises deceived
 I had to send it away to bring us back again Your eyes and body brighten silent waters deep
 Your precious daughter in the other room asleep
 A kiss goodnight from every stranger that I meet
 I had to send it away to bring us back again
 Morning theft unpretender left ungrateful True self is what brought you here to me
 A place where we can accept this love
 Friendship battered down by useless history
 Unexamined failure What am I still to you? Some thief who stole from you?
 Or some fool drama queen whose chances were few?
 That brings us to who we need, a place where we can save
 A heart that beats as both siphon and reservoir You're a woman, I'm a calf, you're a window, I'm a knife
 We come together making chance in the starlight
 Meet me tomorrow night or any day you want
 I have no right to wonder just how or when And though the meaning fits, there's no relief in this
 I miss my beautiful friend
 I had to send it away to bring her back again
                        
                    |
