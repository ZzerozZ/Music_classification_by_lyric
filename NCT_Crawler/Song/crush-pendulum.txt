                        I was running out in the cold light,
Wondering where to go,
To run away, without you.

All my fear is coming home,
And it's ripped out for the show.
You can't be me,
I will become you (tonight).

I was wandering under black skies,
Clutching at what is mine,
No control, left to lose.
When I felt that it wouldn't phase me,
I ran and hid like a child.
I feel so guilty,
I'll make it up to you (tonight).

Bridges I've been dreaming are going down,
They're changing my future.
Visions I had buried underground,
Return us our futures.

I was breaking out of my own skin,
Choking upon release,
I'm in no state, to judge you.
Scratching itches best left alone,
Chasing memories I used to own,
I can't wait until this is over (tonight).

Bridges I've been dreaming are going down,
They're changing my future.
Visions I had buried underground,
Return us our futures.

Well the nightmares Ive been having have arrived,
They're changing my future.
Signs of my creation at my door,
How could you do this to her
                        
                    |
