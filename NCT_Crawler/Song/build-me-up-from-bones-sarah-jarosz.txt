                        Song: Build Me Up From Bones - Sarah Jarosz

Build me up from bones
Wrap me up in skin
Hold me close enough to breathe me in

The moon’s a fingernail
Scratching on the back
Of the night in which we lay beside

[Chorus:]
I held every inch of you
I wrote every line for you
I made time when time was all but gone
You’re the love I’ve always known

The night’s so dark and grey
But you’ve helped me find my way
Through the wild and wonders of this world

So take me with you now
I need to show you how
I can love you better than before

[Chorus]

Play it sweet and low
We’ve got no where to go
I am yours and you’re the love I know
                        
                    |
