                        You're telling me lies
 You're putting me down
 You're starting to make me cry
 Your told me this morning
 You love me so
 But still I know you lie

 You better stop girl
 You better stop now

 You're telling me lies
 You're putting me down
 You're starting to make me cry

 You better stop
 You better stop girl

 You're telling me lies
 You're putting me down
 You're starting to make me cry

 What happened last night
 You was so real
 And so much in love
 What did I say to change your mind
 And give me the brush

 You better stop girl
 You better stop now

 You're telling me lies
 You're putting me down
 You're starting to make me cry

 You better stop now
 You better stop girl

 You're telling me lies
 You're putting me down
 You're starting to make me cry

 Alright

 You're telling me lies
 You're putting me down
 You're starting to make me cry can't you see

 Your told me this morning
 You love me so
 But still I know you lie

 You better stop girl
 You better stop now

 You're telling me lies
 You're putting me down
 You're starting to make me cry

 You better stop
 You better stop girl

 You're telling me lies
 You're putting me down
 You're starting to make me cry
 You're telling me lies
 You're putting me down
 You're starting to make me cry
