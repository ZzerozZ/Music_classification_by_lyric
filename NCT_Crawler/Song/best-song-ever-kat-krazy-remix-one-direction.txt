                        Bài hát: Best Song Ever (Kat Krazy Remix) - One Direction

Harry: 
Maybe it's the way she walked 
Straight into my heart and stole it 
Through the doors and past the guards 
Just like she already owned it 

Zayn: 
I said can you give it back to me 
She said never in your wildest dreams 

All: 
And we danced all night to the best song ever 
We knew every line 
now I can't remember 
how it goes but I know 
that I won't forget her 
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever 
I think it went 
oh oh oh 
I think it went 
yeah yeah yeah 
I think it goes, oh 

Liam: 
Said her name was Georgia Rose 
And her daddy was a dentist 

Harry: 
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth) 
But she kissed me like she meant it 

Niall: 
I said can I take you home with me 
She said never in your wildest dreams 

All: 
And we danced all night to the best song ever 
We knew every line 
now I can't remember 
how it goes but I know 
that I won't forget her 
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever 
I think it went 
oh oh oh 
I think it went 
yeah yeah yeah 
I think it goes, oh 

Louis: 
You know, I know, you know 
I will remember you 
I know, you know, i know 
You'll remember me 

Zayn: 
You know, I know, you know 
I'll remember you 
I know, you know 
I hope you'll remember how we danced 
How we danced 

Harry: 
1, 2, 1, 2, 3 

All: 
And we danced all night to the best song ever 
We knew every line 
now I can't remember 
how it goes but I know 
that I won't forget her 
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever 

Then we we danced all night to the best song ever 
We knew every line 
now I can't remember 
how it goes but I know 
that I won't forget her 
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever 
I think it went 
oh oh oh 
I think it went 
yeah yeah yeah 
I think it goes, oh 

Zayn: 
Best song ever 
It was the best song ever 
It was the best song ever 
it was the best song ever
