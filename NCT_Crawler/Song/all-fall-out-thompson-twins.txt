                        (chorus)
 If you were here
 I could deceive you
 And if you were here
 You would believe
 But would you suspect
 My emotion wandering, yeah
 Do not want a part of this anymore
 The rain water drips
 Through a crack in the ceiling
 And i'll have to spend
 My time on repair
 But just like the rain
 I'll be always falling, yeah
 Only to rise and fall again
 (REPEAT CHORUS)
                        
                    |
