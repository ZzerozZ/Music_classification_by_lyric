                        Bài hát: Best Night - LMFAO, will.i.am, GoonRock, Eva Simons

She never been on a flight,
She never been in a limousine
And now she's living the life
Popping bottles in Italy
She's dancing up on the table
Got everybody's attention in here
She put my hands on her body
And then she whispered in my ear

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for...

I hope this ain't a dream
This better not be no dream
Please don't let this be a simulation
It better be real
'Cause you're a pretty thing
You a motherfucking sexy thing
I hope it's not my imagination
It better be real

I'm dancing on the floor (yeah on the floor)
I'm dancing with you, girl (ooh)
We spinning round and round
You spin me round and round
I'm falling for you girl
I'm falling in love

I know you want it
You know I want you too
I know you like it
I know you like my moves
On Saturday, on Saturday Night Fever (break free)
Now that I got you
Girl, I won't never leave you alone, alone, alone
Call you on my phone
Baby let's party the night away
I'm dancing with you
I wanna party with you, girl

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for...

You never know how it's gonna go
When you bring a chick up in the limousine
Seeing things she's never seen
And you walk up in the club, straight holding her hand, like you're the man
But deep in your heart, you know she's a fan
'Cause she's struck by the stars
And the stars find her striking
You try to play it off 'cause you see a sign of frightening
Will.I.Am is spinning at her
T-pain is winking at her
Ludacris is with his chick but his homeboys giggle at her

What's the matter? Oh nothing
I reply straight, but fronting, wrapped in bottles, started chucking.
She grabbed my hand, pulled me to the dancefloor
We dance close, and then she put my hands low

Oh, I know where this is gonna go
I've seen it in a dream before
I love it when you hold me tight
And then we kiss til the morning light

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for...

Let's make it last for... [repeats]

Let's make it last forever
