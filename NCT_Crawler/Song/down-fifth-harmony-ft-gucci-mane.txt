I need somebody with some patience,
'Cause you know I got a temperament.
Yeah, you got a reputation,
Nothing that a little love can't fix.
There ain't no kinda situation,
Where I wouldn't cross the line for you,
FBI interrogation, I would get up there and lie for you.
When push come to shove,
You show me love,
When push come to shove, 
Eyyyy

Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep loving you, down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep loving you, down, down, down
I'm gon' keep loving you.

You the type that I could bake for (bake for)
'Cause baby you know how to take that cake.
And I'm the only one you wait for,
'Cause baby you know that I'm worth that bake.
When push come to shove,
You show me love,
When push come to shove
Eyyyy

Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep loving you, down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep loving you, down, down, (It's Gucci!) down
I'm gon' keep loving you.

It's like Bonnie and Clyde just walked in,
I gangsta and his bride just walked in,
We on the same team, n' we balling,
Got me showing of my ring, like I'm Jordan,
And I'ma hold you down like you hold me,
And I'll never tell a soul what you told me,
When I was sitting in the cell is when you showed me,
It takes a real one to put her with the old me.
That's why you in the coupe with the low seat, 
That's why we at the game on the floor seats,
The diamonds, you can see 'em from the nosebleeds,
You make a man feel like you won a trophy.

Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep loving you, down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep loving you, down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep loving you, down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep loving you, down, down, down
I'm gon' keep loving you.
