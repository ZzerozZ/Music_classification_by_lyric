                        Title: When I'm Gone
Artist: By 3 doors down
Albums: 3 Doors Down - The Greatest Hits

There's another world inside of me
That you may never see
There's secrets in this life
That I can't hide

Somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find

Maybe it's too far away...

Maybe I'm just blind...

Maybe I'm just blind...

So hold me when I'm here
Love me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am
And everything you need
I'll also be the one
You wanted me to be
I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone

Love me when I'm gone...

When your education x-ray
Can not see under my skin

I won't tell you a damn thing
That I could not tell my friends

Roaming through this darkness
I'm alive but I'm alone

Part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone

So hold me when I'm here
Love me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am
And everything you need
I'll also be the one
You wanted me to be
I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Love me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone

Maybe I'm just blind...

So hold me when I'm here
Love me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am
And everything you need
I'll also be the one
You wanted me to be
I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Love me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
Love me when I'm gone...

Love me when I'm gone...

Love me when I'm gone...

When I'm Gone
When I'm Gone
When I'm Gone
