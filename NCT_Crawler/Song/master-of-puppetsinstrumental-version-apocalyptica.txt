                        End of passion play, crumbling away
 I'm your source of self-destruction
 Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
 Leading on your deaths construction

 Taste me you will see
 More is all you need
 Dedicated to
 How I'm killing you

 Come crawling faster
 Obey your master
 Your life burns faster
 Obey your master
 Master

 Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
 Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
 Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
 Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
 Master
 Master
 Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
 Master
 Master

 Needlework the way, never you betray
 Life of death becoming clearer
 Pain monopoly, ritual misery
 Chop your breakfast on a mirror

 Taste me you will see
 More is all you need
 Dedicated to
 How I'm killing you

 Come crawling faster
 Obey your master
 Your life burns faster
 Obey your master
 Master

 Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
 Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
 Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
 Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
 Master
 Master
 Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
 Master
 Master

 [Interlude:]

 Master, master, where's the dreams that I've been after?
 Master, master, you promised only lies
 Laughter, laughter, all I hear and see is laughter
 Laughter, laughter, laughing at my cries (thanks to me?)

 (solo)

 Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
 Just a rhyme without a reason
 Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
 Now your life is out of season

 I will occupy, I will help you die
 I will run though you, now I rule you too

 Come crawling faster
 Obey your master
 Your life burns faster
 Obey your master
 Master

 Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
 Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
 Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
 Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
 Master
 Master
 Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
 Master
 Master

 [fade out with evil laughter].
