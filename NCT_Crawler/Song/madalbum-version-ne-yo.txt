Singer: Ne-Yo

She's staring at me
I'm sitting wondering
 what she's thinking
Ummm nobody's talking
'cause talking just
 turns into screaming oh
And now as I'm yelling over her
 she yelling over me
All that that means 
is neither of us are listening
And what's even worse
 that we don't even 
remember why we're fighting

So both of us are mad
 for nothing fighting for
Nothing crying for
Nothing oohh

But we won't let it go
 for nothing don't let for

It should be nothing
To a love like what we got oh, baby

I know sometimes it's gonna rain,
But baby can we make up now
'cause I can't sleep through the pain
can't sleep through the pain
Girl I don't wanna go
 to bed mad at you
And I don't want you to go
 to bed mad at me
No I don't wanna go to bed 
mad at you
And I don't want you 
to go to bed mad at me oh no

Umm
And it gets me upset girl
 when you're constantly accusing
asking questions like you
 already know
We're fighting this war baby
when both of us are losing
this ain't the way that love
 is supposed to go
What happened to working it out
We fall into this place 
where you ain't backing down
 and I ain't backing down
So what the hell do we do now

It's all for nothing fighting for
Nothing crying for
Nothing oohh

We won't let it go for nothing 
don't let for
Nothing
It should be nothing
To a love like what we got oh baby

I know sometimes
 it's gonna rain 
Oh, it's gonna rain
But baby can we make up now
'cause I can't sleep
 through the pain 
can't sleep through the pain
Girl I don't wanna go to bed
 mad at you
And I don't want you to go
 to bed mad at me
No I don't wanna go to 
bed mad at you
And I don't want you to go
 to bed mad at me oh no

Oh, baby this love ain't 
gon' be perfect
 perfect perfect oh no
And just how good it's gonna be
We can fuss and we can fight
Long as everything is alright
Between us before we go to sleep

Baby we're gonna be
Happy
Oh oh

Baby
I know sometimes it's gonna rain
it's gonna rain
But baby can we make up now 
can we make up now
'cause I can't sleep through the pain
can't sleep through the pain
Girl I don't wanna go to bed
 mad at you
And I don't want you to go
 to bed mad at me
No I don't wanna go to bed mad at you
And I don't want you to go
 to bed mad at me 
oh, no, no, no
