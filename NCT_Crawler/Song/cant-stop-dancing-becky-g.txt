                        Bài hát : Can't Stop Dancing - Becky G

The lights are shining like the sun out tonight
Just keep your body moving how I like
Oh yeah the music feels like paradise
Can't get any better, no

I wanna stay right in this moment for life
Baby treat me wrong, treat me right

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancing


Again now
Spin around now
Down now, to the floor now

Your mind's just going places I can't see you
That's for the lets me know this is real
And I won't stop you no I like it there
You can even go further babe
Cause nothing's forbidden
Don't scare, no worries
Once I'm there, all is forgiven
So be prepared
To come and push up on my...

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancing

Again now
Spin around now
Down now, to the floor now

Believe it, I feel it
It's in the air
Although you can't see you know it's there
My heart keeps on racing, in overdrive
Once the music hits my body I feel so alive
And it's alright
It's got me like...

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancing

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
I Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancing
