                        Bài hát: Honest - Shawn Mendes

Hey, how's it going?
Can you meet down on Eli street?
Can you talk for a moment?
There's no way to say this that easily
And everything I said, I swear I meant it
I need to tell you that this isn't your fault
And I know that I'll probably regret it
And it kills me 'cause the worst by the phone

It's that I hate to hurt you but I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest
I'm tryna be honest with you
You know that I'm sorry
But I'm tryna be honest with you

Hey, can you listen?
I swear to God to you, there's nobody else
You're gonna say that I'm lying
When I tell you every feeling I felt
Was honest and sincere and that you were different
And when we kissed I felt like that kid in love, yeah
And I know that I'll probably regret it
And I wish I never said this at all

Oh, I hate to hurt you but I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need
Oh, you deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest
I'm tryna be honest with you
You know that I'm sorry
But I'm tryna be honest with you

Oh oh oh, I don't want to see you cry
Oh oh oh, swear that I don't want to see you cry

Cause I hate to hurt you but I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need
Oh, you deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest

I hate to hurt you but I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need
Oh, you deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest
