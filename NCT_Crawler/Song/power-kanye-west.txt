                        I'm livin' in the 21st century, doin' something mean to it
Do it better than anybody ya ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
21st century schizoid man

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothin' to lose, mother***er, we rollin'
Huh? Mother***er, we rollin'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands

In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, *** that, the world's ours

And then they, and then they
And then they, and then they
And then they, and then they
21st century schizoid man

*** SNL and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my ***
I'm an ***? You niggas got jugs

You short minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the Dodies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so ***in' gifted

I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts

Reality is catchin' up with me
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece

Thinkin' no one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder
'Til then, *** that, the world's ours

And then they, and then they
And then they, and then they
And then they, and then they
21st century schizoid man

Holy powers, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole ***in' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation

At the end of day, goddammit, I'm killin' this ***
I know damn well y'all feelin' this ***
I don't need yo' pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?

How Ye doin'? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power, make yo' life so excitin'
(So excitin')

Now this'll be a beautiful death
I'm jumpin' out the window
I'm lettin' everything go
I'm lettin' everything go

This'll be a beautiful death
I'm jumpin' out the window
I'm lettin' everything go
I'm lettin' everything go

Now this'll be a beautiful death
Jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go

You got the power to let power come
