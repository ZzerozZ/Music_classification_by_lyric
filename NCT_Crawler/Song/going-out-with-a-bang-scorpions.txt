                        Bài hát: Going Out With A Bang - Scorpions

If you say we're falling
It's gonna be on our feet
We're gonna take it to town
We'll ride the dark side of the street

If you think we're not fighting
Like we used to do
So are you ready for this
You might learn a bit a trick or two
'Cause all those years of rockin' hard

Have taught us how to rise and how to fall
We're still standing tall

We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
I said we gonna go out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
Out with a bang

If you say we're losing
Watch out we're taking the crown
Thumbs go up all the way
No sign of slowing down

If you think we're excited
I cannot tell you how much
'Cause life's a heartbeat away
And we're never losing touch

'Cause all those years of rockin' hard
Have taught us how to rise and how to fall
We're standing tall

We’re going out with a bang
We’re going out with a bang
I said we gonna go out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
Out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
We’re going out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
Out with a bang

'Cause all those years of rockin' hard
Have taught us how to rise and how to fall
We're standing tall

I said we gonna go out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
Out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
We’re going out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
Going out with a bang, bang, bang
Bang
