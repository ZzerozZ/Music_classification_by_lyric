                        It starts in my belly then up to my heart
 Into my mouth, I can't keep it shut
 Do you recognize the smell?
 Is that how you tell us apart? I fool myself to sleep and dream
 Nobody's here, no one but me
 So cool, you're hardly there
 Why can't this be killing you? Frankenstein would want your mind
 Your lovely head, your lovely head
 Your lovely head
