                        Air, Air
Air, A-air
Air, Air
Air, A-air

I never let love in, I left it on the dresser
I never let love leave an impression
But like a fingerprint now I found you at my fingertips
And I just wanna text you every second
You're always on my mind like reflections on my shades
I gotta look away cause I could stare at you for days
I can give you every millisecond every day
(You, you)
You can buy the time that I can give away

I'm not gonna lie I want your body
But I know there's more than just your body
I don't want you with just somebody
Ima let you know

I need to sit down girl
Cause I can't breathe
You take my breath away from me
Ooh girl can't you see
What you've done to me
You take my breath away from me

You got me, got me fighting for air, air
You got me, got me fighting for air, a- air

Yea, yea, yea

My life isn't measured by the breath's I take
But the moments with you that take my breath away
I don't need you in heels but I need your head over
Come a little closer
Rest your head up on my shoulder
(You, you)
Now you got me smiling
Blown cover
Face with them cupcakes
No butter
They say love is blind but
You're so fine
If I keep you in my life I'd never close my eyes

I'm not gonna lie I want your body
But I know there's more than just your body
I don't want you with just somebody
Ima let you know

I need to sit down girl
Cause I can't breathe
You take my breathe away from me
Ooh girl can't you see
What you've done to me
You take my breath away from me

You got me, got me fighting for air, air
You got me, got me fighting for air, a- air

Hold up
Lemme take a breath
Suffocating
Is there any time left for love?
Le-Lemme take a breath
Suffocating
Is there any time left?

I need to sit down girl
Cause I can't breathe
You take my breath away from me
Ooh girl can't you see
What you've done to me
You take my breath away from me

You got me, got me fighting for air, air
You got me, got me fighting for air, a-air
You got me, got me fighting for air, air
You, you, you, got me, got me fighting for air, a-air
                        
                    |
