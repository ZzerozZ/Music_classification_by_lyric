                        Bài hát: Broken - Jake Bugg

I'll wait here for you for I'm broken.
Down, I'm coming down this town for my heart lies
Far and away where they took you down.
Led them over to your house
Where I'm broken.

Down by the people if they let you breathe.
Don't give a damn if you still can't see,
Still my heart beats for you.

Have become all I lost and all I hoped for.
But I must carry on
Always one
Never broken.

Run to the lobby where I saw you try.
Don't give a damn for your reasons why.
Where soul feels.

Down in the valley where the church bells cry.
I'll lead them over to your eyes.
Whoa, oh, I am one, I am one.

Break story of peace and love in a future
Bright sacrifice came around
Never broken

Down by the people if they let you breathe.
Don't give a damn if you still can't see.
Traveling a street that I did not go.
Wheels like tong to the winter lope.

Down in the valley where the church bells cry,
I'll lead them over to your eyes!
Whoa, oh, I am one
Whoa, oh, I am one
I am one.
                        
                    |
