                        Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oooh [x2]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oooh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oooh

Come feel my heart
It's beating like a drum and I confess
When you're around
It's like an army's marching through my chest

And there's nothing I can do
I just gravitate towards you
You're pulling on me like the moon
I just wanna get you sideways
I say anything I can to get me more than just a dance
Tell me where to put my hands
You know that you could be my favorite one-night stand

You get me higher

What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Do if I said it tonight?
What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Cause you know I la, la, la, lie

You're like a song
A beautiful symphony to my eyes
So take me on
I wanna sing along all through the night

I'm not like the other boys
Cause with you I've got no choice
You make me wanna lose my voice
I just wanna get you sideways
No, I'm not the type to lie
But I might just start tonight
Let me turn off all the lights
You know that you could be my favourite lullaby

You get me higher

What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Do If I said it tonight?
What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Cause you know I la, la, la, lie

Like a symphony
Like a symphony
Like a symphony tonight
Like a symphony
Like a symphony
Like a symphony tonight
Sounds like a symphony
Like a symphony
Like a symphony tonight
Like a symphony
Like a symphony
Like a symphony tonight

What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Do If I said it tonight?
What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Cause you know I la, la, la, la, la, oooh

What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Do if I said it tonight?
What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Cause you know I la, la, la, lie

Ooooh
