                        Bài hát: Sex On Fire - Kings Of Leon

Lay where you're laying
 Don't make a sound
 I know they're watching
 They're watching

All the commotion
 the kiddie like play
 Has people talking
 Talking

You
 Your sex is on fire

The dark of the alley
 The break of the day
 Head while I'm driving
 I'm driving

Soft lips are open
 Them knuckles are pale
 Feels like you're dying
 You're dying

You
 Your sex is on fire
 Consumed
 With what's just transpired

Hot as a fever
 Rattling bones
 I could just taste it
 Taste it

But it's not forever
 But it's just tonight
 Oh we're still the greatest
 The greatest
 The greatest

You
 your sex is on fire

You
 Your sex is on fire

Consumed
 With what's just transpired

And You
 Your sex is on fire

Consumed
 With what's just transpired
                        
                    |
