                        Bài hát: Shoulda Known Better - Janet Jackson

A baby girl without a home
Tragedy's reign left her alone
I guess I shoulda known better
But she's a citizen of the world
A right to life her cry's unheard
I guess I shoulda known better
Why why why why

Part of the revolution
Ready for real solutions
We won't accept excuses
We tolerate no abuses
Cause I don't want my face to be
That poster child for being naive
Why why why why
I guess I shoulda known better

Headlines are real or just the news
Between the lines there's human truth
I guess I shoulda known better
Each day I'm faced with irony but
Just can't feel casual about casualties no
I guess I shoulda known better
I guess I shoulda known better
Why why why why

Part of the revolution
Ready for real solutions
We won't accept excuses
We tolerate no abuses
Cause I don't want my face to be
That poster child for being naive
Why why why why
I guess I shoulda known better

It's never the critic that counts
Cause critics only wanna talk
While enlightened minds and open hearts
Together make this world a better place

Awakening a better choice
It only starts if you lift your voice
And say I shoulda known better
And so next time I'll know better
Why why why why

Part of the revolution
Ready for real solutions
We won't accept excuses
We tolerate no abuses
Cause I don't want my face to be
That poster child for being naive
Why why why why
I guess I shoulda known better
Why why why why
I guess I shoulda known better

I had this great epiphany
And rhythm nation was the dream
I guess next time I'll know better
