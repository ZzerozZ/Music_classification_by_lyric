                        Bài hát: That'S What I Like - Dean Martin

People worry about the pursuit of happiness
It's amazing the amount of time and energy they spend
When there's really only one approach to the present psychological trend

Kiss me kiss me kiss me baby that's what I like
Hold me hug me pet me baby that's what I like
You don't have to give me clever conversation
I just want affection not an education

Kiss me hold me hug me pet me baby that's what I'd like you to do
And love me love me love me baby too

You don't have to give me classy conversation
I just want affection not an education

Kiss me hold me hug me pet me baby that's what I'd like you to do
And love me love me love me baby too
