                        Bài hát: Stereo Hearts - Gym Class Heroes, Adam Levine

[Adam Levine:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio (yeah)
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (I like it)
Just sing along to my stereo

[Travie McCoy:]
Gym Class Heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yeah *** up, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te (yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)
Make me your radio (aha)
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo

[Travie McCoy:]
Let's go!
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox (remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops (turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close (listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio (come on)
Turn me up when you feel low (turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo (sing along)

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo

[Bridge:]
I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your head and hold it closer to mine (yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing (yeah) my mind (come on, whoa)

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio (aha)
Turn me up when you feel low (turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo (it's your boy Travie)
Oh oh oh oh (Gym Class Heroes, baby!) so sing along to my stereo

Yeah
