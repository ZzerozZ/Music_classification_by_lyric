                        Knew the signs
 Wasn't right
 I was stupid for a while
 Swept away by you
 And now I feel like a fool
 So confused
 My heart's bruised
 Was I ever loved by you? Out of reach, so far
 I never had your heart
 Out of reach
 Couldn't see
 We were never
 Meant to be Catch myself
 From despair
 I could drown
 If I stay here
 Keeping busy everyday
 I know I will be OK But I was
 So confused
 My heart's bruised
 Was I ever loved by you? Out of reach, so far
 I never had your heart
 Out of reach
 Couldn't see
 We were never
 Meant to be So much hurt
 So much pain
 Takes a while
 To regain
 What is lost inside
 And I hope that in time
 You'll be out of my mind
 And I'll be over you But now I'm
 So confused
 My heart's bruised
 Was I ever loved by you? Out of reach, so far
 I never had your heart
 Out of reach
 Couldn't see
 We were never
 Meant to be Out of reach
 So far
 You never gave your heart
 In my reach, I can see
 There's a life out there
 For me
