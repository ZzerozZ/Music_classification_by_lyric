                        I’ve got the world on a string
 Sittin' on a rainbow
 Got the string around my finger
 What a world, what a life, I’m in love

 I’ve got a song that I sing
 I can make the rainbow
 Any time I move my finger
 Lucky me, can’t you see, I’m in love?

 Life’s a beautiful thing
 As long as I hold the string
 I’d be a silly so-and-so
 If I should ever let you go

 I’ve got the world on a string
 Sittin' on a rainbow
 Got the string around my finger
 What a world, what a life, mama, I’m in love

 Oh, what a world, what a life
 Baby, I’m in love, is it?
 Looka here, lucky me, can’t you see
 Mama, I’m in love?

 Life’s a beautiful thing
 As long as I hold the string
 I’d be a silly so-and-so
 If I should ever let you go, yes

 What a world, what a, what a life
 Baby, love
 Oh, what a world baby
 Oh, I’m in love, yeah man
