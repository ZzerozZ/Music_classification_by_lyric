R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        Ok, y'all, this is it now bust it
 The mic will sing soon as I touch it
 Do this smooth and easy like
 So we might get hyped in here tonight
 Be nice, relax, MC's further back
 If you ain't with that, I'm-a have to attack you with a bad rap
 That can smack the smile off your face Jack
 So don't start no ***
 Givin' a little bit of heart and soul
 As we do it to you in your earhole
 Huh, I ain't going out like a sucker
 And if you think so, boy, then pucker up
 And kiss the butt of this lyricist
 Blow on the mic and make a wish
 This groove is set to soothe and move you
 Party people now it's time to Get up
 I think the sound will make you (get up)
 Word up, I swear you got to (get up)
 Everybody get up
 Get up
 Everybody get up
 Get up
 Everybody get up Spinderella my DJ's a turntable trooper
 My partner Pepa she's a power booster
 Word to life, I swear, she'll seduce ya
 Don't take my word, I'll introduce her
 I don't need no introduction, I just bust in
 Grab a microphone and then start dustin'
 So-called lyricists can never deal with this
 Swift-lipped vocalists either and also if
 I was a mute, I'd still knock boots
 Put up your dukes, troop, and I'm-a play ya like a flute
 To show you all on me you can't sleep on
 Spinderella, please drop some beats on
 This crowd, pump it up loud
 Gimme a scratch, OK now
 It's time for hell to be raised
 As I kick some lyrics on the beats Hurb made
 Salt's at my side with a shotgun
 A little action? I just had some
 Wicked I say, the girl don't play
 Gonna skip town on Judgement Day
 So don't just sit there like a poo-putt stupid
 The record's called "Get Up", I think you better do it Get up
 Everybody get up
 Get up
 Everybody get up
 Get up
 Everybody get up Salty that's me flippin' on MCs
 I'm not gonna waste your time on the strength, I'll be
 Def, dumb, dope, completely phenominal
 You didn't know? Yeah, right, come on now
 Oh, I'm supposed to believe E-M-C-E-E's
 Are glad Salt is makin' G's?
 Save that ***, I got my public to rap to
 Tried to play me out, I ought to slap you, punk
 For being disrespectful
 I grip the microphone like a pitbull terrier
 Yes, but I'm scarier
 Under a ton of rhymes I'll bury ya
 Hyped like a poet, on the mic I'll show it
 Do-re-mi fa-so-la ti-do it
 Jazz, rhythm, blues, soul, pop, rock 'n roll, even hip-hop
 Lovers, are my brothers and sisters
 All in all over ten billion listeners
 Lend me your ear when you want to hear
 The hypest and ripest sound of the year Get up
 Everybody get up
 Get up
 Everybody get up
 Get up
 Everybody get up
 Get up
 Get up
 Get up
 Get up
