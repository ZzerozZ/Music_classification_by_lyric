                        Bài hát: Losing Sleep - Chris Young

Light a candle 
Turn all the lights down low 
Baby let's just lose control 
Lose control 
I can handle 
Every single curve, you know 
That I love you, let me show you 

Oh 
Fall into me 
Let me breathe the air you breathe 
I can take you anywhere you want to be 
When it comes to us 
Every single touch is something special 
When we're wrapped up in those sheets 

Yeah we're winning, we're losing 
When we're losing sleep 
Real life 
When it's this good don't you know 
We don't need to dream at all 
Baby so 
Fall into me 

Let me breathe the air you breathe 
I can take you anywhere you want to be 
When it comes to us 
Every single touch is something special 
When we're wrapped up in those sheets 
Yeah we're winning, we're losing 
When we're losing sleep 
When we're losing sleep, yeah 
Fall into me 

Let me breathe the air you breathe 
I can take you anywhere you want to be, yeah 
When it comes to us 
Every single touch is something special 
When we're wrapped up in those sheets 
Yeah we're winning, we're losing 

When we're losing sleep 
When we're losing sleep, yeah 
Yeah we're winning when we're losing 
Light a candle 
Turn all the lights down low
