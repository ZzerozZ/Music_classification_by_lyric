                        Song: Pretty Girl - Jon B.

Your lips, your smile, your tenderness, ooh baby
The way you walk, I can't resist your style
When I sleep at night, I dream of you, ooh baby
I wake up wet, thinking of you, ooh baby

How can a man like me, convince a girl like you
To be his lover and one and only
How can I make you see that I'm the one for you
And nobody does it like me, baby

Hey, pretty girl
Can I be your man tonight, baby?
Hey, pretty mama
Can I sleep with you tonight?
Hey, pretty girl when you come to my room tonight
I'll make you come through the night

Your legs around my waist so tight
I'll slide down south to taste you right
You taste so good to me

How does a man like me, seduce a girl like you
How can I make you my one and only
How can I make you scream, there's no one else for you
And nobody does it like me, baby

Hey, pretty girl
Can I be your man tonight, baby?
Hey, pretty mama
Can I sleep with you tonight?

There's a candle that's burning in my heart tonight
And the flame is full of my desire
And I can't help but desire you in my bed tonight

And I'll touch you in the places
Where no one's been before
And I'll kiss you in the places
Men sometimes ignore

Take you to a level
You've never felt before
And though you won't understand it
You'll cry and ask for more

Hey, pretty girl
Can I be your man tonight
