                        Bài hát: What Ifs - Kane Brown, Lauren Alaina

You say what if I hurt you, you say what if I leave you
You say what if I find somebody else and I don't need you
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up
You say what if I break your heart in two then what

Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl but not so fast
Before you make your mind up I gotta ask

What if I was made for you and you were made for me
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close, what if I leaned in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

What if the sky falls (sky falls) or the sun stops burnin'
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (you should kiss me), what if you liked it (but I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

What if I was made for you and you were made for me
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close, what if I leaned in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

Awe yeah
C'mon

You say what if I hurt you, you say what if I leave you
You say what if I find somebody else and I don't need you

Damn

What if I was made for you and you were made for me
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close, what if I leaned in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

Away (away)

What if?
