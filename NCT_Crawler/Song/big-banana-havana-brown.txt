                        DJ Havana Brown, you crazy?
 Havana I heard you had a question though
 Talk to 'em Let's go, thicker than a Magnum, ace of spades
 Strobe light, we can play charades
 My pants keep grenades
 Bananas, clips, shoot for days let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 What? That big fat I'm goin' out tonight
 Got it locked down, I don't want to fight
 I'm a hot girl, I have a right
 Have a right, have a right
 Kill or die hard I'm a call you bruised
 Feel dropped out and I'm a call you Cruise
 Beat it up up up, pop the juice
 Pop the juice, pop the juice Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana If you want that, baby I got it Gi-gi-gi-give me
 Gi-gi-gi-give me
 Gi-gi-gi-give me
 That big fat Freaky *** don't matter black or white
 Let me shake the uh don't cut the light
 Let 'em all bark, I love to bite
 Love to bite, love to bite
 Getting tipsy, ain't getting loose
 I got the vibe, they got the juice
 Beat it up up up, pop the juice
 Pop the juice, pop the juice Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
 Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana Do you have a big banana?
 If you want that, baby I got it
 (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 Let's go, that big fat
 Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
 Let's go, that big fat let's go go She don't know
 Underneath the belt and the Polo
 Thicker than a trunk on a Volvo
 Audemar black with the rose gold Let's go go, she don't know
 Underneath the belt and the Polo
 Thicker than a trunk on a Volvo
 Audemar black with the rose gold
