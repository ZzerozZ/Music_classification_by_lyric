                        Let's go The day has come to an end
 The sun is over my head
 My polyamorous friend
 He got me in a mess of trouble again So just when you think that you're all right
 I'm crawlin' out from the inside
 I never hurt anyone, I never listen at all They've come to get me again
 The cloud is over my head
 My polyamorous friend
 He got me in a mess of trouble again So just when you think that you're all right
 I'm crawlin' out from the inside
 I never hurt anyone, I never listen at all Just stay away from the white light
 I'd say your worst side's your best side
 I never hurt anyone, I never listen at all Well, how do you know?
 Well, how do you know?
 Well, how do you know?
 Well, how do you know? Just when you think that you're all right
 I'm crawlin' out from the inside
 I never hurt anyone, I never listen at all Just stay away from the white light
 I'd say your worst side's your best side
 I never hurt anyone, I never listen at all Let's go
