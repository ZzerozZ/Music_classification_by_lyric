                        Bài hát: Love Yourself - Justin Bieber

For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake

You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
                        
                    |
