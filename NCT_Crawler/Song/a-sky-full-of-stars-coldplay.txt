                        Bài hát : A Sky Full Of Stars - Coldplay

Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars
Cause you light up the path

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms, arms
Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm going to give you my heart

And I don't care, go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

Because you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a Heavenly view
Such a Heavenly view
