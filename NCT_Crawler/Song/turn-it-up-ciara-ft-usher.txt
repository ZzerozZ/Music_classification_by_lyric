                        My head is over my heels 'cause, boy, you got my heart
 And if you play me, it would tear my world apart
 My justice, part of the deal so, baby, play ya cards
 And if you play right, it only gets better Maximum level, emotions are running so high, so high
 Crank up the volume and let it flow, feels so right
 Oh, you're my favorite DJ, baby Turn it up, turn it up
 Just don't break my heart because it's
 Burnin' up, burnin' up
 Don't put out the fire, baby Turn it up, turn it up
 Let's just dance the night away
 I'll take you to your favorite place
 Only if you turn it up Already know what you want, know how to please ya
 Can't love alone 'cause baby, boy, I need you
 You got control of my heart, turn up the level
 Put it on repeat 'cause it goes on and on forever Maximum level, emotions are running so high, so high
 Crank up the volume and let it flow, feels so right
 Oh, you're my favorite DJ, baby Turn it up, turn it up
 Just don't break my heart because it's
 Burnin' up, burnin' up
 Don't put out the fire, baby Turn it up, turn it up
 Let's just dance the night away
