                        Bang out, till the sun comes up
 The wheels fall off in the parking lot
 'Cause I bang out, keep my glock in hand
 While you posted up, chillin' wit cha mans Bang out, won't catch me sleepin'
 While you in the club, rollin' out the keys
 'Cause I bang out, shots go off quick
 Catch yo' ass butt naked while you wit ya bitch
 'Cause I bang out I toss up the set, I walk up in this bitch
 With some gold on my neck, yeah nigga
