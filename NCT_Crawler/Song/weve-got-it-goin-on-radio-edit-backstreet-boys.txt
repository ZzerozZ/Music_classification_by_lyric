                        Bài hát: We'Ve Got It Goin' On (Radio Edit) - Backstreet Boys

Everybody grove to the music
Everybody jam

Oh, hey

We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
Creepin' up and down now
It's time for me to let it go
If you really wanna see
What we can do for you
Send the crazy wildin' static
Sing it

[Chorus:]
Jam on cuz Backstreet's got it
Come on now everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
[2x]

We've got it goin' on for years [2x]

Well I'm creepin' up on your left
Straight up funky when I get with you
Keep it ruthless when I get wet
Keep the party packed in my corner
Tough like granite to keep the crowd hype
Get up on this just to get right
What you want it what you gonna get
Backstreet's got the special effects, uh

If you really wanna see
What we can do for you, oh
I'll send the crazy wildin' static
Sing it

[Chorus]

We've got it goin' on for years [2x]

[Bridge:]
We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
(just can't hold it back no more)
Creepin' up and down now
It's time for me to let it go [2x]

Jam on, jam on

Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam

[Chorus]

We've got it goin' on
                        
                    |
