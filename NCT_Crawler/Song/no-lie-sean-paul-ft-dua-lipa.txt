                        [Dua Lipa:]
Feel your eyes,
They all over me
Don't be shy,
Take control of me
Get the vibe
It's gonna be lit tonight

[Sean Paul:]
Baby girl, yuh a carry ten ton a fatness,
Gimme some a dat
Mixed with the badness,
Look how she act
She a black goddess,
But turn up,
Don’t stop

It's a good piece of mentals under the cap
Hot piece of gear, mami love all your chat
Watching every step of the pep of the what you got
Stayin' in my brain, mama when you're out of touch
And my aim is to give you this love

Hypnotic the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie or play with you
Beam me up like Scottie, baby girl
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie or play with you
Move so hypnotic

[Dua Lipa & Sean Paul:]
No lie
Girl we never miss
Feel your eyes,
They're all over me
Don't be shy,
Bài hát: No Lie - Sean Paul, Dua Lipa

Take control of me
Get the vibe
It's gonna be lit tonight
Girl we never miss, girl we never miss
No lie

Hypnotized,
Pull another one
It's alright,
I know what you want
Get the vibe
It's gonna be lit tonight
Girl we never miss, girl we never miss

[Sean Paul:]
I'm so lit, so lit, my girl
So let me see you roll it, roll it, my girl
Me love it when you bend and fold it
Now let me bone it
And let me own it, my girl
Give you pon the style that I have mastered
Hoist you up, baby girl, that's my word
Give you that good lovin' that is preferred
You deserve it, so don't be scared

It's hypnotic the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie or play you
Beam me up like Scottie, baby girl
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie or play you
Move so hypnotic
