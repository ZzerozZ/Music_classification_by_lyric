                        Bài hát: Love On The Brain (Don Diablo Remix) - Rihanna

[Verse 1]
No matter what
No matter what
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feelin' this way
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feelin' this way

[Pre-Drop]
Must be love, must be love
Mu-mu-must be love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

[Drop]
(Chopped vocals)

[Verse 2]
Be lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
No matter what
Be lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
No matter what
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feelin' this way
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feelin' this way, feelin' this way

[Pre-Drop]
Must be love, must be love
Mu-mu-must be love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
