                        I Got You
Whitney Houston

When your love is strong and it comes from the heart
Ain't no man strong enough, ain't no time long enough to tear it apart
And that's what we had, believe it or not
So on the final day I thought all the hurting pain will end up on top

So I won't cry 'cause you're going away
'cause the chemistry we've got it, don't fade
I won't be wishing for better days
'cause deep inside I know our love stays the same

You gotta know
No matter where you are (you got me)
Baby near or far (you got me)
Our love will never fade (you got me)
So let me hear you say it
baby I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there
Baby I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there
'cause I got you baby

I never lie
'cause you are the reason that my heart is beating, that I am alive
Before you go, thinking that I can be replaced, no
I got you waiting for the rest of my life

You gotta know
No matter where you are (you got me)
Baby near or far (you got me)
Our love will never fade (you got me)
So let me hear you say it
baby I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there
Baby I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there
baby I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be there, I′ll be there
'cause I got you baby

I'll hold you up, just can't stand
I'll make you cry, you think that you can't
By my side forever, baby that's the plan
I'll be your everything, I'll be your everything

No matter where you are (you got me)
Baby near or far (you got me)
Our love will never fade (you got me)
So let me hear you say it
baby I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there
Baby I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be there

Say you want me, I want you baby
Say you love me, I need you baby
I got you baby, you got me
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I love you baby, I love you darling
