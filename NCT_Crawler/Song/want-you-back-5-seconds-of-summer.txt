                        Bài hát: Want You Back - 5 Seconds Of Summer

Can't help but wondering
If this is the last time that I'll see your face
Is it tears or just the *** rain?
Wish I could say something

Something that doesn't sound insane
But lately, I don't trust my brain
You tell me I won't ever change
So I just say nothing

No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back

I remember the freckles on your back
And the way that I used to make you laugh
'Cause you know every morning I wake up
Yeah, I still reach for you

I remember the roses on your shirt
When you told me this would never work
You know even when I say I've moved on
Yeah, I still dream for you

No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back

(I'm always gonna want you back)
(Want you back)
(I'm always gonna want you back)
(Want you back)

You know even when I say I've moved on
You know even though I know you're gone
All I think about is where I went wrong

You know even when I say I moved on
You know even though I know that you're gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
Yeah, I still dream for you

No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back

No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
(I'm always gonna want you back)
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back

(I'm always gonna want you back)
(Want you back)
(I'm always gonna want you back)
(Want you back)
(I'm always gonna want you back)
(Want you back)
(I'm always gonna want you back)
(Want you back)
