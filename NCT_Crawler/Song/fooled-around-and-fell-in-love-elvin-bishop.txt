                        Bài hát: Fooled Around and Fell in Love - Elvin Bishop

I must have been through about a million girls
 I'd love 'em then I'd leave 'em alone
 I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
 Their tears left me cold as a stone
 But then I fooled around and fell in love
 I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did
 I fooled around and fell in love, I fooled around and fell in love
 It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
 I'd get out my book and write down her name
 But when the grass got a little greener over on the other side
 I'd just tear out that page
 I fooled around and fell in love
 I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby
 I fooled around and fell in love, I fooled around and fell in love
 Free, on my own is the way I used to be
 Ah, but since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me
 It's got a hold on me now, I can't let go of you baby
 I fooled around and fell in love
 I fooled around and fell in love, oh yes I did
 I fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, fooled around,
 fooled around, fooled around, fell in love
 Fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, fooled around,
 fooled around, fooled around, fell in love
 I fooled around, fell in love
 I fell in love, I fell in love, yes I did
