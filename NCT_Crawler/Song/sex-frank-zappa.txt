 Sex
 When they wanna be suave 'n' debonair
 Sex What's poppin' up the most from coast to coast
 Sex
 At yer bongo party an' yer weenie roast
 Sex Even them christians who are born again
 Sex
 Go out 'n' get pooched every now 'n' then
 Sex Do ya do or don't ya don't
 Sex
 Bet yer lyin' if ya say ya won't
 Sex Some girls try it 'n' go on a diet
 Then they worry 'cause they's too fat
 Who wants t'ride on a ironin' board?
 That ain't no fun...i tried me one Grow that meat all over yer bones
 Work the wall with the local jones
 'n' while you do it, remember this line
 The sniffer says it all the time "the bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
 The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
 The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
 The bigger the cushion..." Makes no difference if you're young or old
 Sex
 Don't you act like it's made of gold
 Sex Ladies they need it just like the guys
 Sex
 Maybe you could use a protein surprise
 Sex Any time, anywhere
 Sex
 Why d'ya think it's growin' there
 Sex Some girls try it 'n' they don't like it
 They complain 'cause it don't last
 Who wants to ride on a debutante?
 They talks too much...they moves too fast Watch the scenery while you ride
 You can be very warm inside
 'n' when the train goes 'round the bend
 Check the shrub'ry on the other end "the bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
 The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
 The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
 The bigger the cushion..."
