                        Bài hát: Dazzle - Oh Wonder

You got diamonds in your eyes tonight
Throwing fire, trying to make it right
You’re getting higher than the ceiling lights
And falling hard enough to lose the fight

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose

Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money

There’s a human in your heart of hearts
Hiding true colours made you fall apart
In the mirror you’re a work of art
But this is real life, real life

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose

Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money

Give me neon lights, roll me paper heights
I can feel the dice, cooling me
See the plastic life through my bloodshot eyes
I am wild alive, I am wild alive

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose
(Give me that gold)

Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money
