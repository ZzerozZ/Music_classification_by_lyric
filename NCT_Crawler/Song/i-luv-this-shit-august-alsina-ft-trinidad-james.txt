 Man I luv this ***
 Man I luv this ***

 And I luv this ***
 And I luv this ***
 And I luv this *** It's two o'clock and I'm faded
 This kush feeling amazing
 Got a voice mail on my phone
 From a lil breezy feeling X-rated
 She told a nigga she hatin'
 I'm in the car and I'm swervin'
 I walked into her bedroom
 I put it down that's certain
 Man I stay on that Ciroc
 Man I stay taken shots
 May your girl be on my jock Maybe because I'm everything your not
 See I ain't no bitch nigga no rich nigga
 No snitch nigga I'ma real nigga that's real nigga
 I'm just trying to chill 'cause
 I'm way too drunk to be talking like this
 I'm way too had to be trippin like this
 I'm way too young to be livin like this
 Ask me why I do it
 I'ma put it like this
 God dammit I luv it, I luv it
 I luv it, I luv it
 God dammit I luv it
 I luv it, I luv it
 I luv it
 So I'ma keep on drinking 'cause I luv this ***
 And I'ma keep on smoking 'cause I luv this ***
 And I'ma keep on grinding 'cause I luv this ***
 She tell me keep fuckin' 'cause she luv this ***
 And I luv it Rollin' through my hood rolling up some good
 Shorty let be rolling on the wood
 Damn she rode it good
 Rollin' over I aint sleepin over
 Now she rollin' the eye
 Rollin' on the floor laughing
 Cause she looks so surprised
 Girl, you been around the block
 And I been on that Ciroc
 Got your man circling the block Maybe because I'm everything your not
 See I ain't no bitch nigga no rich nigga
 No snitch nigga I'ma real nigga that's real nigga
 I'm just trying to chill cause
 I'm way too drunk to be talking like this
 I'm way too had to be trippin like this
 I'm way too young to be livin like this
 Ask me why I do it'
 I'ma put it like this
 God dammit I luv it, I luv it
 I luv it, I luv it
 God dammit I luv it
 I luv it, I luv it
 I luv it
 So I'ma keep on drinking 'cause I luv this ***
 And Ima keep on smoking 'cause I luv this ***
 And I'ma keep on grindin 'cause I luv this ***
 She tell me keep fuckin' 'cause she luv this ***
 And I luv it What you know about love
 Well love know about you
 When I try something new
 You refuse to believe that my love is true (God damn)
 So I use all I got to prove to you
 But the proof ain't enough so you move onto the next dude like
 What he gon do' (Ha)
 I don't understand this girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
 I don't understand this girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
 Looking for a real nigga
 Like in all the wrong places
 And all the wrong ways
 They don't care, they don't change 'cause
 She gon do what she want
 And that is okay
 And he gon do what he want
 And that is okay
 I said I luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it (luv it, luv it)
 He nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing about it
 Lil' bitch I luv it, I luv it
 I luv it, I luv it
 God dammit I luv it
 I luv it, I luv it
 I luv it
 So I'ma keep on drinking 'cause I luv this ***
 And I'ma keep on smoking 'cause I luv this ***
 And I'ma keep on grinding 'cause I luv this ***
 She tell me keep fuckin' 'cause she luv this ***
 And I luv it
