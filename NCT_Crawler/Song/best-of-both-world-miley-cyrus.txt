                        Bài hát: Best of both world - Miley Cyrus

Oh yeah
Come on

You get the limo out front (Ooh oh ooh)
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color
Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun
It's really you, but no one ever discovers

In some ways, you're just like all your friends
But on stage you're a star

You get the best of both worlds (Both worlds)
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds (Both worlds)
Mix it all together
And you know that it's the best of both worlds
The best of both worlds
Yeah

You go to movie premieres
(Was that Orlando Bloom?)
Hear your songs on the radio (Ooh oh ooh oh oh)
Living two lives is a little weird, yeah
But school's cool 'cause nobody knows (Nobody knows)

Yeah, you get be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitar

You get the best of both worlds (Both worlds)
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds (Both worlds)
Mix it all together
And you know that it's the best of both
You know the best of both worlds

Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazines
The best part is that
You get to be whoever you want to be

(Best, best)
Yeah, the best of both
(Best, best)
You got the best of both
(Best, best)
Come on, best of both

Who would've thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar?
Whoo!

You get the best of both worlds (Both worlds)
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds (Both worlds)
Mix it all together
And you know that it's the best

You get the best of both worlds (Both worlds)
Without the shades and the hair
You can go anywhere
You get the best of both girls (Both girls)
Mix it all together
Oh yeah
It's so much better
'Cause you know you've got the best of both worlds
                        
                    |
