                        Bài hát: Glitter & Gold - Barns Courtney

I am flesh and I am bone.
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter
Like glitter and gold.
Like glitter

Do you walk in the valley of kings?
Do you walk in the shadow of men
Who sold their lives to a dream?
Do you ponder the manner of things,
In the dark
The dark, the dark, the dark

I am flesh and I am bone.
Arise, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter
Like glitter and gold.
Like glitter

Do you walk in the meadow of spring?
Do you talk to the animals?
Do you hold their lives from a string?
Do you ponder the manner of things
In the dark
The dark, the dark, the dark

I am flesh and I am bone.
Arise, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter
I am flesh and I am bone.
Arise, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter

'Cause everybody's in the backrooms
Spinning up
Don't know what you're asking for.
And everybody's in the front rooms
Tripping out
You left your bong at the door.

'Cause everybody's in the backrooms
Spinning up
Don't know what you're asking for
And everybody's in the front rooms
Tripping out
You left your bong at the door.

I am flesh and I am bone.
Arise, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter
Like glitter and gold.
Like glitter
Like glitter and gold
Like glitter
