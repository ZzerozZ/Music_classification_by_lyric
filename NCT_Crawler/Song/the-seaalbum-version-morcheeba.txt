                        Flocking to the sea
 Crowds of people wait for me
 Sea gulls scavenge
 Steal ice cream
 Worries vanish
 Within my dream

 I left my soul there,
 Down by the sea
 I lost control here
 Living free

 I left my soul there,
 Down by the sea
 I lost control here
 Living free

 Fishing boats sail past the shore
 No singing may-day any more
 The sun is shining
 The Water's clear
 Just you and I walk along the pier

 I left my soul there,
 Down by the sea
 I lost control here
 Living free

 I left my soul there,
 Down by the sea
 I lost control here
 Living free

 A cool breeze flows but mind the wasp
 Some get stung it's worth the cost
 I'd love to stay
 The city calls me home
 More hassles fuss and lies on the phone

 I left my soul there,
 Down by the sea
 I lost control here
 Living free

 I left my soul there,
 Down by the sea
 I lost control here
 Living free

 I left my soul there,
 Down by the sea
 I lost control here
 Living free

 I left my soul there,
 Down by the sea
 I lost control with you,
 And living, living,
 And I, living, by the sea
                        
                    |
