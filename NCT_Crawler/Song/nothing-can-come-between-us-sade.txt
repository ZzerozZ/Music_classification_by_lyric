                        Always hope that you remember
 We'll never really learn the meanin' of it all
 What we have is strong and tender
 So hold on In the middle of the madness
 When the time is runnin' out and you're left alone
 All I want is you to know that
 It's strong still, can't pull us apart Nothing can come between us
 Nothing can pull us apart
 Can come between us I always hope that you remember
 What we have is strong and tender
 In the middle of the madness
 Hold on So it truly is a good thing
 And I always wanted you to know
 There is always this and this is everlastin'
 Hold on It's about faith
 It's about trust, yeah yeah
 It's about faith
 It's about trust Nothing can come, nothing can come
 Nothing can come between us
 Nothing can come, nothing can come
 Nothing can come between us Nothing can come, nothing can come
 Nothing can come between us
 Nothing can come, nothing can come
 Nothing can come between us Nothing can come, nothing can come
 Nothing can come between us
 Nothing can come, nothing can come
 Nothing can come between us Nothing can come, nothing can come
 Nothing can come between us
