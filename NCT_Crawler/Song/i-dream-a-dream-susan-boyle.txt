                        I dreamed a dream in time gone by 
When hope was high 
And life worth living 
I dreamed that love would never die 
I dreamed that God would be forgiving. 

Then I was young and unafraid 
And dreams were made and used 
And wasted 
There was no ransom to be paid 
No song unsung 
No wine untasted. 

But the tigers come at night 
With their voices soft as thunder 
As they tear your hope apart 
As they turn your dream to shame. 


And still 
I dream he'll come to me 
That we will live the years together 
But there are dreams that cannot be 
And there are storms 
We cannot weather... 

I had a dream my life would be 
So different form this hell I'm living 
so different now from what it seemed 
Now life has killed 
The dream I dreamed.
