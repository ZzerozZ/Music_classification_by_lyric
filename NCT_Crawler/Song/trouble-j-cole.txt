                        I said set it off on my left
 Set it off on my right
 I said liquor all in my breath
 Bitches all in my sight
 I said real niggas trying to ***
 *** niggas wanna fight
 I said gun shots into the air
 But I ain't scared for my life
 I said Yeah, God flow
 Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
 Niggas sayin' live fast, die young, so I drive slow
 And pray I die old
 In the drop with the top low
 Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
 Kept it straight, ***, cause y'all know
 And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the chi go
 I ain't *** her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
 My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
 The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
 If I gotta be frank about it, ain't worth the stress
 First the text, then the draws, see first the sex
 Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
 Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
 Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
 Cole on twitter, bitch can't get a follow
 Can get a nut, heard "can't get enough"
 Now she *** a nigga thinkin' that she may hit the lotto
 No way, Jose
 Could write a book called, "the things hoes say"
 Show a lot of love to my sisters though
 But these bitches so predictable
 I'm in trouble
 Getting to the promised land
 You don't want problems, I promise, man
 I take you to the promise land
 You don't want problems, I promise, man I said set it off on my left
 Set it off on my right
 I said liquor all in my breath
 Bitches all in my sight
 I said real niggas trying to ***
 *** niggas wanna fight
 I said gun shots into the air
 But I ain't scared for my life
 I said And I'm going back to school
 Only for the hoes and a class or two
 Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
 Everybody sweat her like catholic school
 Sat next to her in the back of the class
 Cheated off of her test and I'm grabbing her ass
 She like "don't you know this *** already?
 Nigga, ain't you rich already?"
 Yeah, but I got dumb as ***
 Hanging 'round these rappers cause they dumb as ***
 But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
 Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
 That's one stereotype
 Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
 Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
 I'm koopa, I never been the Mario type
 No saving hoes
 I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches
 That a nigga went to school with is major hoes
 And theirs mans don't know, mans don't know, fa show
 Had a nigga's baby, little mans don't know
 Mama, was a freak, got it in on the low
 12 years later when my song come on, he ask
 "mama, did you *** J. Cole?"
 Whoa Getting to the promised land
 You don't want problems, I promise, man
 I take you to the promise land
 You don't want problems, I promise, man Set it off on my left
 Set it off on my right
