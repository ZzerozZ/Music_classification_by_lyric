                        I've heard it before
 And you're telling me no, and I'm crazy
 We're talking too fast
 We've just got to take it nice and slow
 Sit back let it flow now


 Don't be misunderstood
 When baby, maybe, you know


 We're gonna be so good
 Like I knew we would
 Like only we could
 Come on and hear me now
 Gonna be so good
 Coz it's understood
 Like I knew we should
 So good now, baby


 No matter the cost
 When we're out on the town
 Getting lazy
 I'll show you who's boss
 We're just gonna take it all away
 No matter what they say now


 Be so good
 Be so good now


 Chorus

 So good
 Coz it's understood
 You know we're good
                        
                    |
