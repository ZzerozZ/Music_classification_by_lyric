                        Bài hát: Stubborn Love - The Lumineers 

She'll lie and steal, and cheat, and beg you from her knees 
Make you think she means it this time 
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair 
But I still love her, I don't really care 

When we were young, oh, oh, we did enough 
When it got cold, ooh, ooh, we bundled up 
I can't be told, ah, ah, it can't be done 

It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all 
The opposite of love's indifference 
So pay attention now, I'm standing on your porch screaming out 
And I won't leave until you come downstairs 

So keep your head up, keep your love 
Keep your head up, my love [x2] 
Keep your head up, keep your love 

And I don't blame you dear for running like you did all these years 
I would do the same, you'd best believe 
And the highway signs say we're close but I don't read those things anymore 
I never trusted my own eyes 

When we were young oh, oh, we did enough 
When it got cold, ooh, ooh we bundled up 
I can't be told, ah, ah, it can't be done 

So keep your head up, keep your love 
Keep your head up, my love [x2] 
Keep your head up, keep your love 
Head up, love 
Head up, love 
Head up, love 
Head up, love
                        
                    |
