                        Bài hát: Copycat - Billie Eilish

Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamor
Why so sad when you can't have mine?

Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamor
Why so sad when you can't have mine?

Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych!

By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamor
Why so sad when you can't have mine?
