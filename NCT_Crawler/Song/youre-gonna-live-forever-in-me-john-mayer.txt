                        Bài hát: You're Gonna Live Forever In Me - John Mayer

A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

But you're gonna live forever in me
I'll guarantee, just wait and see

Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be

And when the pastor rises the pews
From reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

But you're gonna live forever in me
I'll guarantee, just wait and see
