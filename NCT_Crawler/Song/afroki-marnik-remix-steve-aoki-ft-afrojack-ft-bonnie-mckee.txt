I was afraid to be myself.
I was afraid that you could tell.
I was afraid of what I felt.
I was afraid it wasn't real.

But I wanna get up, up, up
And I wanna let go, oh, oh
'Cause I'm ready to take control.
Take a look at me,
Take a look at me,
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
No
I'm not afraid anymore

I'm not afraid anymore

Cold in the shadow of my doubt
So scared to step out from the crowd
But I am a wildfire now
Too hot for you put me out

'Cause I'm burning it up, up, up
And I'm tearing it down, own, own
I've been waiting here long enough
Take a look at me
Take a look at me
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
No
I'm not afraid anymore

No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)
No fear (I'm ready)

No fear and no tears
I'm not afraid anymore, anymore
No fear and no tears
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid anymore

I'm not afraid anymore
