 {Yeah}

 {Woo}


 Silly of me
 Devoted so much time
 To find you unfaithful, boy
 I never lost my mind


 Drive pass your house every night
 In an unmarked car
 Wonderin' what she had on me
 To make you break my heart, yeah

 You make me feel I'm so gone (So gone), oh...
 You make me {You make me feel}
 Whoa and I love you to love you, baby, I {So gone},
 Ooh


 Nights I couldn't sleep, uh
 You let the sun beat you home
 I asked myself over again
 What am I doing wrong


 To make you stay out all night
 And not think to call
 What does she have over me
 To make him not think to call home

 Listen, boy, I'm a rowdy chick
 Some times I have to fight 'cause my mouth too slick
 Baby, why you doin' me like I ain't worth this s***
 Make me wanna ride passed your house and sit
 Kick down your door and smack your chick
 Just to show you Monica not havin' it
 So in love with you like a drug habit get
 {So gone} You treat me so unreal


 What she do, I do better (Ooh...oh...)
 What she do to make you love her (What did she do)
 Is it real or forever
 Baby, please can't we stay together (Is it real or
 Forever)
