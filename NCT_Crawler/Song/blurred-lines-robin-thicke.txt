                        [Intro: Pharrell] 
Everybody get up 
Everybody get up 
Hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey 

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke] 
If you can't hear what I'm trying to say 
If you can't read from the same page 
Maybe I'm going deaf, maybe I'm going blind 
Maybe I'm out of my mind 

[Pre-chorus: Robin Thicke] 
OK now he was close, tried to domesticate you 
But you're an animal, baby it's in your nature 
Just let me liberate you 
Hey, hey, hey 
You don't need no papers 
Hey, hey, hey 
That man is not your maker 

[Chorus: Robin Thicke] 
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl 
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
You're a good girl 
Can't let it get past me 
You're far from plastic 
Talk about getting blasted 
I hate these blurred lines 
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
But you're a good girl 
The way you grab me 
Must wanna get nasty 
Go ahead, get at me 

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke] 
What do they make dreams for 
When you got them jeans on 
What do we need steam for 
You the hottest bitch in this place 
I feel so lucky 
Hey, hey, hey 
You wanna hug me 
Hey, hey, hey 
What rhymes with hug me? 
Hey, hey, hey 

[Pre-chorus: Robin Thicke] 
OK now he was close, tried to domesticate you 
But you're an animal, baby it's in your nature 
Just let me liberate you 
Hey, hey, hey 
You don't need no papers 
Hey, hey, hey 
That man is not your maker 
Hey, hey, hey 

[Chorus: Robin Thicke] 
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl 
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
You're a good girl 
Can't let it get past me 
You're far from plastic 
Talk about getting blasted 
I hate these blurred lines 
I know you want it 
I hate them lines 
I know you want it 
I hate them lines 
I know you want it 
But you're a good girl 
The way you grab me 
Must wanna get nasty 
Go ahead, get at me 

[Verse 3: T.I.] 
One thing I ask of you 
Let me be the one you back that ass to 
Yo, from Malibu, to Paribu 
Yeah, had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you 
So hit me up when you passing through 
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two 
Swag on, even when you dress casual 
I mean it's not almost unbearable 
Then, honey you're not there when I'm 
With my foresight bitch you pay me by 
Nothing like your last guy, he too square for you 
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that 
So I just watch and wait for you to salute 
But you didn't pick 
Not many women can refuse this pimpin' 
But I'm a nice guy, but you get it if you get with me 

[Bridge: Robin Thicke] 
Shake the vibe, get down, get up 
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt 
What you doing like word 

[Pre-chorus: Robin Thicke] 
Baby can you breathe? I got this from Jamaica 
It always works for me Dakota to Decatur, uh huh 
No more pretending 
Hey, hey, hey 
Cause now you winning 
Hey, hey, hey 
Here's our beginning 

[Chorus: Robin Thicke] 
I always wanted a good girl 
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
You're a good girl 
Can't let it get past me 
You're far from plastic 
Talk about getting blasted 
I hate these blurred lines 
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
But you're a good girl 
The way you grab me 
Must wanna get nasty 
Go ahead, get at me 

[Outro: Pharrell] 
Everybody get up 
Everybody get up 
Hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey
