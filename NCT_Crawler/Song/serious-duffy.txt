                        I always wanted to see the colors of your destiny
 I always wanted to know a flower that would grow
 Serious, serious Im a trophy on your arm
 You wear me like a charm, yes you do
 An accessory that suits
 Your new suede boots I get a feeling deep down inside
 Something just ain't right
 I get a feeling that tells me I know
 Baby you never show How you really feel for me
 Tell me, can we ever be
 Serious, serious in love? A joke on my expense
 In front of all your friends, all the time
 A game you like to play
 Leaves me solo every day I get a feeling deep down inside
 Something just ain't right
 I get a feeling that tells me I know
 Baby you never show How you really feel for me
 Tell me can we ever be
 Serious, serious in love
 Serious, serious in love? I get a feeling deep down inside
 That something just aint right
 I get a feeling that tells me I know
 Baby you never show How you really feel for me
 Tell me, can we ever be, tell me
 Serious, serious in love? Serious, serious
 Serious, serious
 Serious, serious
