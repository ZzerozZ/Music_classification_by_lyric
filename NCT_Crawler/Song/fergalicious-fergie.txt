To all Chinaman in LA!
Baby
I know you\'re hurting right now
But Don\'t worry
I\'ll be your superman(no, no)
I can love you like no one can
I can be your superman (superman)
just take my hand let\'s fly away
I promise I\'ll be there everyday
just close your eyes let\'s start to fly
I\'m gonna love you until I die(till I die)
Until the day of my death to my very last breath
I\'m gonna love you when no ones left

Come fly with me baby
Yeah I\'m the one
With the S on my chest
Forget about your ex
He don\'t know what love is
He just failed the test
Plus he don\'t treat you right
He keeps you crying all night
See, hes like your kryptonite
I came to give you their strength
So you can leave him behind
You can start all over
Just press rewind
Cause he don\'t understand that you\'re one of a kind
So sweet, so sexy and just so fine
I will fight to my death just to make you mine
I will never neglect you
Never have time to stress you
And always respect you
Girl you like a hidden treasure
and I promise to love you
From now until forever
OOO para siempra mija
Te prometo Te voy amar
hasta la muerte

I can love you like no one can
I can be your superman (superman)
just take my hand let\'s fly away
I promise I\'ll be there everyday
just close your eyes let\'s start to fly
I\'m gonna love you until I die(till I die)
Until the day of my death to my very last breath
I\'m gonna love you when no ones left

I\'m the type of guy
That will stand by your side
To wipe them tears when they fall from your eyes
I\'m the one you hold when your nights is cold
The one that stays near to fight away your fears
You aint gotta be scared
See I put an end to your ex
No more beating you up (nuh uh)
Or pulling on your hair
See I came to save the day
A man like that should\'nt treat you that way
And I don\'t understand why\'d you take that route?
Look at yourself
Your beautiful inside and out
You need to drop that zero (uhh)
Let me swoop you off your feet
Cause I can be your superhero
Do you follow my lead?
I guarantee you baby
I\'m all that you need
See, you can change your plans
All you got to do is call on me and I can be your superman

Will you be by my side for the rest of my life?
For the rest of my life
Will you love me till I die?

I can love you like no one can
I can be your superman (superman)
just take my hand let\'s fly away
I promise I\'ll be there everyday
just close your eyes let\'s start to fly
I\'m gonna love you until I die(till I die)
Until the day of my death to my very last breath
I\'m gonna love you when no ones left

No ones left
Till no ones left
Till no ones left
Gonna love you
Gonna love you
My superman
My superman
