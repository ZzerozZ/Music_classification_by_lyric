[SoHee]
Listen to me now my heart is screamin' out
I'm tryna show you how to touch me
I'm not just a girl, I'm more precious than pearls
And I deserve all you got babe
[Lim]
So if you're gonna hold me
Baby don't let go of me
Give me all you got I want everything
My heart is a treasure one that can't be measured
Let me show you how to love me

[CHORUS]

Love me like money Love me like cars
Love me babe love me babe wherever you are
Love me all close love me from afar
Love me babe love me babe wherever you are
[Sun]
Love me like money love me like cars
Love me babe love me babe wherever you are
Hold me like diamonds and treat me like a star

[Akon]
Stop listening to your friends
They just want your man
Misery loves a little company
Don't feed until them lies, Want you by my side
Why is it so hard to trust me?
Let go of your fears girl, promise i'll be here girl
I wont let your heart skip a beat
I'll take care of you and you take care of me girl
Won't ever leave you lonely

[Akon]
Love you like money Love you like cars
Love you babe love you babe wherever you are
Love you all close love you from afar
Love you babe love you babe wherever you are
Love you like money love you like cars
Love you babe love you babe wherever you are
Hold you like diamonds and treat you like a star
Love you babe love you babe wherever you are

[YuBin]
Before I will do something
Seen a little sunshine seen a little rain
My heart's been through some pain
And I don't wanna go back to the little game
So I'm letting you know up-front
If you plan on being the one, listen to my instructions
Cause imma teach you how to ([Akon] Love you like love you like)
Under the bills, brand new wheels ([Yenny] Love me like love me like)
Fresh new hair-cut baby I need you to ([Akon] Love you like love you like)
New turn kicks bikes under risk ([Yenny] Love me like love me like)

[CHORUS]
[Yenny]
Love me like money Love me like cars
Love me babe love me babe wherever you are
Love me all close love me from afar
Love me babe love me babe wherever you are

Love me like money love me like cars
Love me babe love me babe wherever you are
Hold me like diamonds and treat me like a star
Love me babe love me babe wherever you are

[Sun] Love me babe love me babe ([Akon] Wherever you are)
