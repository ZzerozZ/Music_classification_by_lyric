                        Bài hát: Eternal Love (Healer OST) - Michael Learns To Rock

It's a beautiful feeling
What we got deep inside
We got a flame that will last forever
Together you and I

Such a rush of emotions
There's no way we can push it away
Cuz they'll never tear our love apart
Our bond will never break

Do you believe in the power
Of everlasting love
We can make it if we stay together
Our love is just enough

Promise me this forever
We'll always stay this way
We can start at the end of time
And do it all again

Oh my love
I'm all yours
And there will never be another one
‘cause I'm eternally yours
My heart's a flame
And it's burning in your name
Even through the sands of time
My love will always grow
And I won't let go

No matter if you're near of far
Our bond will never break

Promise me this forever
We'll always stay this way
We can start at the end of time
And do it all again

Oh my love
I'm all yours
And there will never be another one
‘cause I'm eternally yours
My heart's a flame
And it's burning in your name
Even through the sands of time
My love will always grow
And I won't let go

It's a beautiful feeling
We've got deep inside
And there will never be another one
‘cause I'm eternally yours
My heart's a flame
Such a rush of emotions
Burning in your name
We can't push it away
Even through the sands of time
My love will always grow
My eternal love
                        
                    |
