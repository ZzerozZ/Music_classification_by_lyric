Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Baby,
 They asked me how I knew
 My true love was true
 I of course replied
 "Something here inside
 Cannot be denied"

 They said someday you'll find
 All who love are blind
 When your heart's on fire
 You must realise
 Smoke gets in your eyes

 So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
 To think they would doubt my love
 Yet today, my love has flown away
 I am without my love

 Now laughing friends deride
 Tears I cannot hide
 So I smile and say
 "When a lovely flame dies,
 Smoke gets in your eyes. "
                        
                    |
