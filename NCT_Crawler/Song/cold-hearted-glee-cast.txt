                        He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes 
Oh ohhh 
He's been tellin' lies 
He's a lover boy at play 
He don't play by rules 
Oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool--no 

You're the one givin' up the love 
Anytime he needs it 
But you turn your back and then he's off 
and runnin' with the crowd 
You're the one to sacrifice 
Anything to please him 
Do you really think he thinks about you 
when he's out 

He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes 
Oh ohhh 
He's been tellin' lies 
He's a lover boy at play 
He don't play by rules 
Oh oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool--no 

It was only late last night 
He was out there sneakin' 
Then he called you up to check that you 
were waiting by the phone 
All the world's a candy store 
He's been trick or treatin' 
When it comes to true love girl with him 
there's no one home 

He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes 
Oh ohh 
He's been tellin' lies 
He's a lover boy at play 
He don't play by rules 
Oh oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool--no 

You could find somebody better girl 
He could only make you cry 
You deserve somebody better girl 
He's c-cold as ice 

He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes 
Oh ohhhh 
He's been tellin' lies 
He's a lover boy at play 
He don't play by rules 
Oh oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool--no 

He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes 
Oh ohh 
He's been tellin' lies 
He's a lover boy at play 
He don't play by rules 
Oh oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool
