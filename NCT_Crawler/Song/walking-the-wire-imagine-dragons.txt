                        Bài hát: Walking The Wire - Imagine Dragons

Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes

Oh the storm is raging against us now
If you're afraid of falling then don't look down
But we took the step or we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We've gotta be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

There's nights we had that just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry but those tears will fade
It's the price we pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We've gotta be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

Oh I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes
Love

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We've gotta be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
                        
                    |
