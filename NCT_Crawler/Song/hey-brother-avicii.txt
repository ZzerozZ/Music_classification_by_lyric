                        Bài hát: Hey Brother - Avicii 

[Verse 1] 
Hey, brother, there’s an endless road to re-discover. 
Hey, sister, know the water's sweet but blood is thicker. 
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you 
There’s nothing in this world I wouldn't do. 

[Verse 2] 
Hey, brother, do you still believe in one another? 
Hey, sister, do you still believe in love I wonder? 
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you 
There’s nothing in this world I wouldn't do. 

[Chorus] 
Ah, what if I'm far from home? 
Oh, brother, I will hear you call. 
What if I lose it all? 
Oh, sister, I will help you out! 
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you 
There’s nothing in this world I wouldn't do. 

[Verse 3] 
Hey, brother, there’s an endless road to re-discover. 
Hey, sister, do you still believe in love I wonder? 
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you 
There’s nothing in this world I wouldn't do. 

[Chorus] 
Ah, what if I'm far from home? 
Oh, brother, I will hear you call. 
What if I lose it all? 
Oh, sister, I will help you out! 
Oh, if the the sky comes falling down, for you 
There’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do.
