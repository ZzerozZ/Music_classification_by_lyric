                        Prayer
 Let your arms enfold us
 Through the dark of night
 Will your angels hold us
 Till we see the light
 Hush, lay down your troubled mind
 The day has vanished and left us behind
 And the wind, whispering soft lullabies
 Will soothe, so close your weary eyes
 Let your arms enfold us
 Through the dark of night
 Will your angels hold us
 Till we see the light
 Sleep, angels will watch over you
 And soon beautiful dreams will come true
 Can you feel spirits embracing your soul
 So dream while secrets of darkness unfold
                        
                    |
