                        Bài hát: You Said You'd Grow Old With Me - Michael Schulte

I'd like
To say
I'm ok
But I'm not
I try
But I fall
Close my mind
Turn it off

I can't be sober
I cannot sleep
You've got your peace now
What about me?

Thought we had the time, had our lives
Now you'll never get older, older
Didn't say goodbye, now I'm frozen in time
Getting colder, colder
One last word
One last moment
To ask you why
You left me here behind
You said you'd grow old with me

We had plans
We had visions
Now I can't see ahead
We were one
We were golden
Forever you said

I can't be sober
I cannot sleep
You've got your peace now
What about me?

Thought we had the time, had our lives
Now you'll never get older, older
Didn't say goodbye, now I'm frozen in time
Getting colder, colder
One last word
One last moment
To ask you why
You left me here behind
You said you'd grow old with me
                        
                    |
