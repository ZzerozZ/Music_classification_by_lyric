                        Intro

 Hey, yeah ya know what?
 I like the players
 No Diggity, No doubt
 Play on play that
 Play on play that
 Yo Dre drop the verse
 Rap

 It's going down Fade to Blackstreet
 The homeys got abby collab creations Funk like acne
 No doubt I put it down never slouch
 As long as my credit could vouch
 A dog couldn't catch me ********* out
 Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves
 Attracting honeys like a magnet
 Giving them ear-asms with my mellow accent
 Still moving his flavor with the homeys Blackstreet & Teddy
 The original rump shakers
 Verse 1

 Shorty get down, good Lord
 Baby got 'em open all over town
 Strickly biz she don't play around
 Cover much grounds
 Got game by the pound
 Gettin paid is her forte
 Each and every day true player way
 I can't get her outta my mind (well)
 I think about the girl all the time (well well)

 East side to the west side
 Push your fat rides it's no surprise
 She got tricks in the stash
 Stacking up the cash
 Fast when it comes to the gas
 By no means average
 She's on when she's got to have it
 Baby your a perfect 10, I wanna get in
 Can I get down so I can win
 Chorus

 I like the way you work it
 (no diggity)
 I got to bag it up
 I like the way you work it
 (no diggity)
 I got to bag it up
 (bag it up girl)
 I like the way you work it
 (no diggity)
 I got to bag it up
 (bag it up)
 I like the way you work it
 (no diggity)
 I got to bag it up
 Verse 2

 She's got class and style
 Street knowledge, by the pound
 Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
 Catching villians is a no
 Let me tell you how it goes
 Curve's the word, spin's the verb
 Lovers it curves so freak what you heard

 Rollin with the fatness
 You don't even know what the half is
 You gotta pay to play
 Just for shorty bang bang to look your way
 I like the way you work it
 Trump tight all day, everyday
 You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
 Baby I can get you in my ride
 Chorus

 Interlude

 Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
 (hey yo that girl looks good)
 Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
 (play on play on player)
 Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
 (you're my kind of girl)
 Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
 Verse 3

 'cause that's my peeps and we rows "D"
 Flying first class from ny City to Blackstreet
 What chu know about me
 Not a motha fuckin' thing
 Cartier wooded frames supported by my shorty
 Rap

 Ask for me
 Icy gleem and pinky diamond ring
 We be's the baddest clickup on this scene
 Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
 High shows and proves, no doubt
 I be diggin' you so

 Please excuse if I come across rude
 That's just me and that's how a player's got to be
 Stay kickin' game with a capital "G"
 Ask the peoples on my block I'm as real as can be

 Word is bond
 Faking moves never been my thing
 So Teddy pass the word to your nigga Chauncey
 I'll be sending a car, lets say around 3: 30
 Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity
 Chorus

 Outro

 Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo

 Tomeka in full effect
 Ladies in full effect
 Ain't nothing goin' on but the rent
