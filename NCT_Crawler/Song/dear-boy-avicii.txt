                        Bài hát: Dear Boy - Avicii

1. So bold and fine
I've known you for some time
Whole life changed while
Bones like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods and
Down we go, down, down
Oh boy, you're mine
Do you remember old times?

[Chorus x2:]
Go dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Go dear boy, I wanna be with you
There's a time for everything and I call you.

2. Oh love of mine, distraction ain't a crime
Dear Boy lyrics on ***
For those who find love as a game like you and I
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we cry
Oh boy, you're fine, do you remember old times?

[Chorus]
                        
                    |
