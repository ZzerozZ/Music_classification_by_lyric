                        Back in the days of knights in armor
 There once lived a lovely charmer
 Swimming in the Rhine
 Her figure was divine

 She had a yen for all the sailors
 Fishermen and gobs and whalers
 She had a most immoral eye
 They called her Lorelei

 She created quite a stir
 And I want to be like her

 I want to be like that gal on the river
 Who sang her song to the ships passing by
 She had the goods and how she could deliver
 The Lorelei

 She used to love in a strange kind of fashion
 With lots of hey-ho-de-ho-hi-de-hi
 And I can guarantee I`m full of passion
 Like the Lorelei

 I`m treacherous, yeah-yeah
 Oh, I just can`t hold myself in check
 I`m lecherous, yeah-yeah
 I want to bite my initials on a sailor`s neck

 Each affair has a kick and a wallop
 For what they crave, I can always supply
 I want to be just like that other trollop
 The Lorelei

 I want to be just like that other trollop
 The Lorelei
