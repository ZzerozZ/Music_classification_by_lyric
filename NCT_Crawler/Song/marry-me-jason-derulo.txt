                        105 is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That’s precisely what I plan to do

And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
Will forever be enough, so there ain’t no need to rush
But one day, I won’t be able to ask you loud enough

[Chorus]
I’ll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I’ll say will you marry me

How many girls in the world can make me feel like this?
Baby I don’t ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You’re the love of my life

You know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
Will forever be enough, so there ain’t no need to rush
But one day, I won’t be able to ask you loud enough

[Chorus]
I’ll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I’ll say will you marry me

[Bridge]
And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing
‘Cause I have you, girl I have you
So get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be
Better, better
The day when I say

I’ll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I’ll say will you marry me

I’ll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I’ll say will you marry me

Ooh whoa ooh oh
Ooh whoa ooh oh
Ooh whoa ooh oh

105 is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That’s precisely what I plan to do...
