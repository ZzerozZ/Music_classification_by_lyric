                        Bài hát: Start Over - Imagine Dragons

Clenched teeth, no words
All this distance taking its toll
Speaking volumes, silence screaming over your words

I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I want to try again

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Before it's over, over

Cold nights, cold sheets
One more lonely empty hotel room
What I'd, give to, find my way back into you

I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I want to try again

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Before it's over, over

Can we start over?
Can we get closer?
Can we start over?
Before it's over, over

Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again

Can we start...

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Before it's over, over

Can we start over?
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again)
Can we get closer?
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again)
Can we start over?
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again)
Before it's over, over
                        
                    |
