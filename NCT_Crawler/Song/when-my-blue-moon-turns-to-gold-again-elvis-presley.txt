                        Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
 When my rainbow turns the clouds away
 Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
 You'll be back within my arms to stay When the memories that linger into my heart
 Memories that make my heart go cold
 However some day they gonna live again sweetheart
 And my blue moon again will turn to gold Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
 When my rainbow turns the clouds away
 Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
 You'll be back within my arms to stay When the memories that linger in my heart
 Memories they gonna make my heart grow cold
 Well, you know some day they gonna live again sweetheart
 And my blue moon again will turn to gold Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
 When my rainbow turns the clouds away
 Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
 You'll be back within my arms to stay
