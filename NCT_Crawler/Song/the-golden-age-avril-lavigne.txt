                        I wished I lived in the golden age Giving it up on the Broadway stage Hang with the rats and smoke cigars Have a break with Frank and count the stars
Dressed to the nines, with hair to match Shiny jewels, casino cash Tapping feet, wanna take the lead A trip back in time is all I need
Oh! Sing it out loud gonna get back honey Sing it out loud get away with me Sing it out loud on a trip back honey Sing it out loud and let yourself free
Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
I'm on my way, gonna make it big Gonna make these songs for the chicks to dig It's really hot and a little bit sour We're getting your strength to maximum power
Flying away from reality Whatever-ever happened to gravity? I see it clear, a shooting star And I'm really gonna sing it like da-da-da
Sing it out loud gonna get back honey Sing it out loud get away with me Sing it out loud on a trip back honey Sing it out loud and let yourself free
Yeah!
Sing it out loud gonna get back honey. Sing it out loud get away with me Sing it out loud on a trip back honey Sing it out loud and let yourself free
Yeah-yeah! Woah-oah! Wow!
Ohhh silver screen on a rainy day Sally Bowles in Cabaret Shaking sticks, oh what a show Fresh and jolly, from tip to toe
Rambling down the boulevard With a fire burning in a wooden heart My mind is set, I won't be lying But I never really thought it would feel this fine
Yeah! Sing it out loud gonna get back honey Sing it out loud get away with me Sing it out loud on a trip back honey Sing it out loud and let yourself free
Sing it out loud gonna get back honey Sing it out loud get away with me Sing it out loud on a trip back honey Sing it out loud and let yourself free!
Yeah! Hey! Hey! Whoo! Ooh! Oooooaaahh!
Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
