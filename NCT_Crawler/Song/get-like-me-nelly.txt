                        Bài hát: Get Like Me - Nelly

All yall niggas wanna get like me
Surrounded by bitches that look like these
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it
All my niggas be blowing on trees
I'm so sick so they throwing up keys
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it

I say all yall niggas wanna get like me
All yall niggas wanna get like me
Now who wanna shake don't look and see
And then count the bitches, nigga 1, 2, 3
I said and if you feel like something else there
Then tell er that you down for something else yea
And if she say 'cause as far as it goes
Don't worry, she straight like a actress nose
You can ball and ball, do it wall to wall
Just saying that you can't do it small is all
You can floss Rolex over Audemar
On the arm and I'm outshining all of yall
Can you feel it? Hey hey
Do you want more? Hey hey
Til yo back sore hey hey
So let's go, let's go

All yall niggas wanna get like me
Surrounded by bitches that look like these
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it
All my niggas be blowing on trees
I'm so sick so they throwing up keys
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it

UNH! I'm the shizzniyee.
You should follow my example - Bitch, i.e.
Cause I'm front row, Isaac Mizrayee.
In the truck but I ain't suck diznayee!
All these hoes wanna get like me
Get their own speakers and some pros like me
When I'm at the game, all the pros like me
Bitch I'm a pro, ain't a ho like me
Bitches ain't stuntin' in the cold like me.
Some call me bitchie, so Nicole Like me
Pull up in the ghost, East Coast like me.
My nigga spend money like the coke price free
Uhn! Bon voyage, Nicki M. Baby, Buns Minaj.
Back-of-the-'Bach Slumpty, Humpty Dumpty;
On the back of the bike, these stunts be comfy!

All yall niggas wanna get like me
Surrounded by bitches that look like these
They know it, you know it
You know it, you know it
All my niggas be blowing on trees
I'm so sick so they throwing up keys
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it

You wrong
Why you dance so low to this song?
Where your boyfriend at? He gone
Is that a napkin? Can you put your number on?
You so wrong
Drop down shawty, get yo eagle on
Tell yo boyfriend you staying with Simone
Matter fact put yo number in my phone
I'm a fly nigga tatted up with the fade
Yea I was rockin' waves when them niggas had braids
Air Force 1's then I took em all to J's
Now they wanna play dumb like they from the bay
I was touring overseas, 2-50 everyday
Just came back in the middle of the may
In the Maybach with this chick named May
Wanna know if she can do me, shawty yes you may
See the whole rap game sounded like me
Put that on the drums but it sounded like P
Shawty say she horny, sound like E
Say she wanna bring her partner, okay that sound like 3
Fresh off the yacht, feet in the sand
Walk in the club, me in demand
Got a whip on the lot, bout 400 grand
Go around my neck, pistol close at hand, cause

All yall niggas wanna get like me
Surrounded by bitches that look like these
They know it, you know it
You know it, you know it
All my niggas be blowing on trees
I'm so sick so they throwing up keys
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it
