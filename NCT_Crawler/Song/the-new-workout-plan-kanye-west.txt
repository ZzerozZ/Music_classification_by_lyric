 "Get Right for the Summer" workout tape

 You might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
 Man, at least a dude wit' a car
 So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
 Nobody wants a little tight ass! 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit-ups right and
 Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
 Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
 Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
 It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
 Tell me who's invited, you, your friends and my dick What's scary to me, Henny make girls look like Halle Berry to me
 So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
 Thank you, God bless you, good night, I came

 Unless she talk about freakin' out, then maybe we can work it out
 Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out now

 My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said get it wet
 Ooh, girl your breath is harsh, cover your mouth up like you got SARS Off them tracks yeah I bought them cars still kill a nigga on 16 bars
